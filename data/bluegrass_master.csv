Each day I’ll do a golden deed
By helping those who are in need
My life on earth is but a span
And so I’ll do the best I can
   Life’s evening sun is sinking low
   A few more days and I must go
   To meet the deeds that I have done
   Where there will be no setting sun
To be a child of God each day
My life must shine along the way
I’ll sing His praise while the ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul
While going down life’s weary road
I’ll try to lift some traveler’s load
I’ll try to turn the night to day
Make flowers bloom along the way
The only life that will endure
Is one that’s kind and good and pure
And so for God, I’ll take my stand
Each day I’ll lend a helping hand

I was born in the heart of the country
In a town in the middle of the land
I grew up in a second city
Since I left my home I’ve been travellin’ back. 
To a time when a family tried to stay together
Back to the time when a love survived
When a woman and a man built a home forever
And they tied a knot for the rest of their lives. 
My brother’s gone to New York City
And I find myself in a corner of the west
My mom and daddy left their home and each other
Ten miles apart, more apart than the rest. 
I’m singing songs of the poor and the homeless
I’m singing songs of a love that died
But my saddest song is the song of a family
A million miles apart with a broken tie.

Oh tonight dear I’m thinking of days long gone by 
Of my childhood sweetheart who left me to cry
Amid broken vows now you left me alone
I wonder if my heart can lead you back home
I wonder if my heart can lead you back home
Now once we were happy with love in our hearts
Stole each night together vowed never to part
But a new love has won you with him you’ll abide
You’re happy my darling but I’m left to cry
You’re happy my darling but I’m left to cry
Oh meet me my darlin please meet me alone
We’ll stroll once together where often we roamed
And if you are sure that your new love is right
My heart will be blue as a dark starless night
My heart will be blue as a dark starless night

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-distant-land-to-roam/,"A Distant Land To Roam

I remember very well
On one dark and dreary day
Just as I was leaving home
For a distant land to roam
   Mother said (mother said)
   My dear boy (my dear boy)
   I hope to see you next year again
   Fare you well (fare you well)
   fare you well (fare you well)
   So I left my dear old home
   For a distant land to roam
Now I wandered far away
From my home I’ve gone astray
Now I’m coming coming home
Never more from thee to roam
And these words she said to me
As she took me by the hand
If on earth we meet no more
May we meet at God’s right hand

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-face-in-the-crowd/,"A Face In The Crowd

A face in the crowd on your wedding day
You tossed me a rosebud from your bridal bouquet
No one seemed to notice no one wondered why
When you pledged your love to him there were tears in my eyes.
   A face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose
   Your gown of white satin my half-worn-out clothes
   I knew your love one time but your love now he holds
   I’m a face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose.
As your friends they all kissed you I heard someone say
The man with the rosebud from your bridal bouquet
Was he kind of special or was he just a friend
I heard you speak softly he was only a friend.

   A lock of your hair and a faded red ribbon
   Is all I have left to remind me of you
   A lock of your hair and a faded red ribbon
   Is all I have left of a love we once knew
   Is all I have left of a love we once knew
I know I mistreated you and you went away
You found somebody new and now I must pay
Listen here boys if you have a sweetheart
Show her you love her and make her your wife
For the lock of her hair and a faded red ribbon
Will make you unhappy for the rest of your life
Will make you unhappy for the rest of your life
listen here boys is you have a sweetheart
Show her you love her and make her your wife

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-fallen-star/,"A Fallen Star

A star fell from heaven right into my arms
A brighter star I know I’ve never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
   A fallen star is what you are
   The twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
   you must have strayed from the milky way
   A fallen star that’s what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I’m sure they’ll miss a star as bright as you
But the stars will send there blessing and brighter they will shine
When they see the dream that’s comin’ true

Mother first was called to heaven
Left our home all alone
Dad took sick soon and joined her
They’re reunited on god’s throne
   A few more tiring days still face us
   A few more weary nights shall come
   We’ll all be on our way to heaven
   When a few more seasons come
In springtime when the flowers blossom
Spreading their fragrance through the air
Walking through the little churchyard
Soon we’ll all be resting there

A few more years shall roll, a few more seasons shall come
Then we shall be with those at rest asleep within the tomb

   Wash me in Thy precious blood and take my sins all away
A few more meetings here shall cheer us on our way
And we shall reach that endless rest on that eternal day

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-few-old-memories/,"A Few Old Memories

Just a few old memories slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it so tightly before
I can’t understand it why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place in time
   Just a few old keepsakes way back on the shelf
   No they don’t mean nothing I’m surprised that they’re left
   Just a few old love letters with their edges all brown
   And an old faded picture I keep turned upside down
Just a few old memories going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember I don’t know why I’m crying
I can’t understand it well I’m surprised at my self
First thing tomorrow morning I’ll clean off that shelf

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-flower-blooming-in-the-wildwood/,"A Flower Blooming in the Wildwood

On one evening long ago as the sun was sinking low
My true lover went to sail up in the sea
It was in the month of June when the roses were in bloom
When he tucked me in his arms and said to me
   You’re a flower that is blooming in the wildwood
   A flower that is blooming there for me
   Sweeter than the morning dew and I’ll soon return to you
   You’re a flower that is blooming there for me
Then a letter came to me from the captain on the sea
That told me my darling was dead
Oh the shock and great surprise made the teardrops dim my eye
When I thought about the last words that he said
Now he can’t return to me he got drowned in the sea
And has done passed over life’s weary way
When it’s in the month of June and the roses are in bloom
It seems that I can hear my lover say

Pardon me if I’m sentimental when we say goodbye
Don’t be angry with me darling should I cry
When you’re gone I’ll dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there’s a fool such as I
   Now and then there’s a fool such as I am over you
   You thaught me how to love and now you say that we are thru
   I’m a fool but I love you dear until the end of time
   Now and then there’s a fool such as I

Whipoor wills and daffodils are pretty things
All the works of nature that we see each spring
All the pretty colors at a rainbows end
Could never match the beauty on your face I’ve seen
You brought me laughter you gave me joy
You brought me pleasure like a kid with a Christmas toy
You brought me sunshine from up above
And that’s not all you brought you gave me love
Honeysuckles morning glories ’round my door
Honey bees that gather nectar and much more
Smiling faces childrens laughter skies above
All that I could ask form them you gave me love

I was a rover, on land and on sea
’til a good woman’s love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning, it was so incomplete
’til a good woman’s love put me back on my feet
   Still a-roamin’ I go home in the evening and she’s waiting there
   and I know that no matter what happens she’ll always care
   and when night falls and the moon shines above
   I’m a man with a dream and a good woman’s love

   Well a hundred years from now I won’t be crying
   A hundred years from now I won’t be blue
   And my heart will have forgotten that she broke every vow
   I won’t care a hundred years from now
Oh, it seems like only yesterday you told me
You couldn’t live without my love somehow
Now that you’re with another it breaks my heart somehow
I won’t care a hundred years from now
Now do you recall the night sweetheart you promised
Another’s kiss you never would allow
That’s all in the past dear it didn’t seem to last
I won’t care a hundred years from now

I’ve wandered by the village Tom I’ve set beneath the tree
Upon the schoolhouse playing ground that sheltered you and me
But none are left to greet me Tom and few are left to know
That played with us upon the green just fifteen years ago
The river’s running just as still the willows on its side
Are larger than they were dear Tom the stream appears less wide
But in kneeling down beside the stream dear Tom I startled so
To see how sadly I am changed since fifteen years ago
But when our time shall come dear Tom and we are called to go
I hope they’ll lay us where we played just fifteen years ago
Just fifteen years ago

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-life-of-sorrow/,"A Life Of Sorrow

After traveling through this world of sorrow
No one on earth to call my friend
I’m on my way back to old Kentucky
Where I met and loved but could not win.
I’ve always loved you little darling
My heart will always feel the same
I could never do one thing to hurt you
I’d rather die than bring you shame.
When that cold dark shroud is wrapped around me
They lay my weary head to rest
Will you stand around and gaze upon me
For I’m the one that loved you best
When your golden hair is turned to silver
The master calls your soul to heaven
Where we can be free from all our troubles
I’ll meet you there at journey’s end

In a war torn land of poverty somewhere across the sea
A little boy is waitin’ he looks a lot like me
His hair is like the sunlight on the wings of a crow
I don’t know what they named him but I’m sure they called him Joe
   Just a little boy called Joe like so many more I know
   Left all alone somewhere across the sea
   I want him to have my name little Joe mine to claim
   A little boy called Joe belongs to me
His mother died to give him life the night my orders came
I wanted to be with him but war’s an evil thing
Now he won’t recongnize me but I’ve got to let him know
He means much more to some one than just a little boy called Joe

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-lonesome-night/,"A Lonesome Night

In the pale moonlight we quarreled one night
Our hearts were young and free
I left her there alone at night
I thought she was two-timin’ me
   On a lonesome night and far from home
   I heard a mourn-ful sound
   The girl I love is call-in’ me
   She thinks I turned her down
She begged me not to leave her there
She said she had been true
But a jealous heart would not believe
Oh how I long for you
So now I’m on my way back home
Sweetheart do you still care
I promise never to leave your side
And your love I always share

I bid farewell to my home so dear
And started down life’s road
I was a fortune seeking miner dear
Many things had been my goal
There’s many things I’ve seen in life
I thought I’d like to own
But I’d give them all and more if I
Could get off this lonesome road
It’s a lonesome road to travel on
Many miles of sorrow is all I’ve known
But I’ve gone too far to turn back now
From this lonesome lonesome road
I left behind a love that’s true
She cried and begged me not to go
But my foolish pride told me what to do
And put me on this lonesome road
Oh such lonely nights I’ve never found
No time in life before
If she takes me back I’ll settle down
And travel this road no more

I am a man of constant sorrow
I’ve seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised
For six long years I’ve been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I find
For in this world I’m bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
It’s fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I’m bound to ride that Northern railroad
Perhaps I’ll die upon this train
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
It’s fare you well to a native country
The places I have loved so well
For I have seen all kinds of trouble
In this cruel world no tongue can tell
Maybe your friends think I’m a stranger
My face your’ll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I’ll meet you on God’s golden shore

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-memory-of-you/,"A Memory Of You

I turned the key in the lock tonight
And walked slowly into the room
Your presence hung like a heavy mist
And I knew death had come to soon
The stars maybe shining for somebody else
The moon maybe giving us light
But all that I have is a memory of you
And I’m lost in a world black as night
Death came too soon to the one that I love
And now I must travel alone
Just a wanderin’ boy with a broken heart
Whose sweetheart and pal is now gone
I’ll travel on through this world of dispair
I’ll just force myself to go on
I find myself wishing ev-‘ryday
I could be with her in the beyond

In my memory there’s a picture of a face so dear to me
Loving arms that used to hold me as I sat on mother’s knee
No one here on earth could pay her for the things in life she gave
Now she’s gone but I’ll remember’ a pretty wreath for mother’s grave
   She was fond of pretty flowers
   I recall she used to say
   When I’m gone son please remember
   A pretty wreath for mother’s grave
She had a little row of flowers that she used to watch each day
She fixed them just before God called her so they would not fade away
Next year they’ll bloom again in beauty red and blue so bright and gay
If it’s God’s will I’ll take them to her a pretty wreath for mother’s grave

While strolling through the fields of time there’s many things to see
But nature is the greatest sight that could ever be
But the greatest of them all is how the world was formed
And why the roses had to live each day among the thorns
 One day among the world of thorns a rose began to grow
 It was the greatest gift of God this world will ever know
 It was the will of God to show that since the world was formed
 There had to be a rose to live and die among the thorns
Two thousand years will soon be gone since God looked down with love
He filled this earth with beauty with roses from above
He hung upon a rugged cross to save the world from sin
Between two thorns this rose He died three days He bloomed again

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/a-satisfied-mind/,"A Satisfied Mind

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I’d do things my way
How little they know that it’s so hard to find
One rich man in a hundred with a satisfied mind
Once I was living in fortune and fame
Had everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life’s game
Then suddenly it happened I lost every dime
But I’m richer by far with a satisfied mind
Money can’t buy back your youth when you’re old
Or a friend when you’re lonely or a heart that’s grown cold
And the world’s richest man is a pauper at times
Compared to a man with a satisfied mind
When my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I’ll leave there’s no doubt
But one thing’s for certain when it comes my time
I’ll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

You’ll never find a sweeter love
Than the love you gave to me
But I would not be satisfied
Now you no longer care for me.
   Now you’ve gone and left me alone
   Oh why did I ever let you go?
   In this world I can never find
   A sweeter love than yours I’ll never know.
Now my future looks so cold
So cold without you my dear
I realize that I’m to blame
But for my wrong I’m paying dear.
Now I think of you both night and day
I’m sorry dear I ever let you go
I know now that it’s too late
A sweeter love than yours I’ll never know.

He was just a little farm lad so busy at play
In his little play house down by the gate
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door
At the home of his tiny playmate
   Then he saw his Daddy watching too
   As the man swiftly walked to the cottage door
   He knew they were strangers that come from the town
   Men he had never seen before
They soon were at their work and he heard his Daddy say
Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no he cried dear God don’t let it be
They can’t take my sweetheart away
   I know Dad that you don’t understand
   How a heart so young can conceive a plan
   I’m only seven now but it’s just like you said
   Dad someday I’ll be a man
The man who runs the farm where your playmate now lives
He told me it’d have to be this way
For winter time has come and their work is all done
So now they are moving away
   Let us buy the farm so they can stay
   Give them all my toys that dear Santa gave
   And give him the pennies in my little bank
   Pennies that my darling helped me save

There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on
I lost two points just for being in the right place at exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there but I may as well have been completely blind.
But if you see me walking all alone
Don’t look back ’cause I’m on my way back home
There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on.
Signing ink to the contract
baby
said it would all be so lifelong
Looked around then for the reason when there wasn’t something more to blame it on.
So if time makes a difference while we’re gone
Tell me now and I won’t be hangin’ on
There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on.
Thirteen-twenty
North Colombus was the address I had written on my sleeve
Don’t know what it was she wanted
might have been that it was gettin’ time to leave.
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed as the joker said
lead on
There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on.

Oft’ my thoughts drift back to childhood
To the time when I was free
As I played before the fireside
‘Round my darling Mother’s knee
   There’s a blessed home up yonder
   Where my loved ones wait for me
   I saw Mother in a vision
   Kneeling there to pray for me
Then one day our Mother left us
Daddy said she’d gone to rest
I remember how she loved me
As she clutched me to her breast
Some sweet day I’ll meet you Mother
Your little boy is commin’ home
To see you as in days of childhood
The one you loved and left alone

   I hear a voice callin’
   I’ll gain the reward
   In the land where we shall never shall die
The Savior has paid a great price for me
He gave His life on Calvary
So I’ll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day
He died on the cross
the old rugged cross
That we would be saved from sin and not lost
So I’ll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
And we’ll pay that debt on the great judgement day

There are soldier boys their precious lives they give
So their loved ones here back home many miles across the foam
Might have liberty each padding day to live
May they sleep forevermore
Where a white cross stands to mark the soldiers grave
May their spirits be at rest
They have done their part with hearts so true and brave
May the ones who have gone on be remembered here back home
In the hearts of those whom they will see no more
They will wait until that day when they hear the trumpet play
Then they’ll march again upon that golden shore

To the grave not far away

But she did not go alone
The greatest part of me went with her
The day the savior called her home
As I looked back across my life time
As I journey on and on
I bless the days that I had with her
And I leave the rest to God
In a grave so dark and lonely
Neath the cold and silent clay
There we laid my little darling
Just a year ago today

The fairest bloom the mountain know
Is not an iris or a wild rose
But the little flower of which i’ll tell
Known as the brave acony bell
Just a simple flower so small and plain
With a pearly hue and a little known name
But the yellow birds sing when they see it bloom
For they know that spring is coming soon
Well it makes its home mid the rocks and the rills
Where the snow lies deep on the windy hills
And it tells the world “why should i wait
This ice and snow is gonna melt away”
And so i’ll sing that yellow bird’s song
For the troubled times will soon be gone

Adieu false heart now we must part
May the joys of the world go with you
I’ve loved you long with a faithful heart
But never any more can I believe you
I’ve seen the time I’d have married you
And been your constant lover
But now I’d gladly give you up
For one whose heart is truer
You think you are too good for me
You think I am forsaken
But if you think that I care for you
You are very much mistaken
My mind is like the constant sun
From the east to the west it ranges
While yours is likened to the moon
It’s every month it changes
When I lay down to take my rest
No scornful one to wake me
I’ll go straightaway unto my grave
Just as fast as time can take me
Adieu false heart now we must part
May the joys of the world go with you
I’ve loved you long with a faithful heart
But never any more can I believe you

The bottle is almost empty

Darlin’ i had to call you
To our favorite place again
I know it’s wrong for us to meet
But the fires gone out at home
And there’ nothin’ cold as ashes
After the fire is gone
Your lips are warm and tender
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot
Each time we say it’s the last time
But we keep hangin’ on
And there’s nothin’ cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/age/,"Age

I’ve been up and down and around and ’round and back again
I’ve been so many places I can’t remember where or when
And my only boss is the clock on the wall and my only friend
Never really was a friend at all
   Well I traded love for pennies and sold my soul for less
   Lost my deals in that long tunnel of time
   And I turned inside out and ’round about and back again
   Found myself right back where I started again.
Once I had myself a million now I’ve only got a dime
The difference don’t seem quite as bad today
With a nickle or million I was searchin’ all the time
For something that I’ve never lost or left behind.
And now I’m in my second circle and I’m headin’ for the top

I remember when I made you cry
Ages and ages ago
I’ll never blame you for our last good bye
Ages and ages ago
Something told me when you walked away
That my poor heart would miss you so
And though it happened only yesterday
It seems like ages and ages ago
Someone came along and took my place
How wrong I was to let you go
And though it happened only yesterday
It seems like ages and ages ago

Left New York this morning early
Traveling south so wide and high
Sailing through the wide blue yonder

She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that’s flying homeward
It’s that air mail special on the fly
Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California
It’s that air mail special on the fly
Watch her circle for the landing
Hear her moan and cough and sigh
Now she’s coming down the runway

your beautiful sunlight
Your fields of cerecea potatoes and corn
Alabama
your crimson red clover
All mingled around the old place I was born.

your hills and your valleys
Your creeks with laughter as onward they flow
Alabama
so sweet in the springtime
Sweet ferns and wild flowers and winter with snow.

so sweet to my mem’ry
You shine like a light on a beautiful hill
Alabama
in days of my childhood
I labored and toiled at the old sorghum mill
Alabama
when red leaves are failing
I roam through your pastures with fences of rail
Alabama
when ‘possums are crawling
And hound dogs are howling and wagging their tails.
Alabama
your beautiful highways
All curved through the mountains where love ones do wait
Alabama
your golden rod flower;
And the “Welcome home’ sign hanging over the gate
Alabama
to me you are callin’
My footsteps are haltered no longer to stray

you hold all I long for
You hold all I love so I’m coming today

Somebody just asked you what sign you are
And I see you’re thinkin’ you maybe should’ve stayed home
But you’re tired of being alive and alone 
In your brand new hairdo, you look real fine
I hear you toast yourself, today you’re twenty-nine
And you’re riding on what the future brings
An honest man who wants the simple things. 
There’s Tiffany lamps here to brighten up the gloom
The conversation sounds like a locker room
Where will you find love, you’re living in a tiny world
And at the office they call you an old fashioned girl 
You sit so silent, sipping at a beer
Catching your reflection in a tinted mirror
And you shopped all day for that brand new dress
What a price to pay, for settling for less 
I see you there at the Brass Rail Bar

In shark-infested waters her plane went down that night

And prayed that she might fly on safe again
In years to come when others blaze a trail across the sky
We’ll never forget Amelia and her plane.

Since my true love she ain’t around
   I hate to see the sun a sinking
   Another night to toss and turn
   Another night to dream about her
   Another night for her I yearn
She had no cause to go and leave me
For I had never done her wrong
She left our home and little children
And with another she has gone
The children they are soundly sleeping
No they don’t know that their mother’s gone
What can I do when they awaken
I can’t tell them that their mother’s wrong

I heard you whisper we’d meet again
Another place another time
   Won’t that room of mine be a lonely place to be
   After I’ve been holdin’ you so close to me
   Won’t that ol’ stairway be a little hard to climb
   To a lonely room to wait for
   Another place another time
Chairs are stacked on the tables and it’s closing time
They say I could wait right here forever
If they’d only let me stay
Any place would be much better
Than that ol’ lonely room of mine
And a sleepless night awaitin’ for

   I’m gonna make the same ol’ rounds

I’ve been a working all week long
and ain’t nothin’ that’s gone right

It’s another Saturday night.
With a pretty girl in my arms
and a lonesome juke box song
I never think of Monday morning

Pretty Mama’s there for me
and I’m gonna motor time
I’m like a wound up clock on Friday
I got to run down Saturday night
It’s another Saturday night

Put my money in the juke box

And when my money’s spent and gone
tell me something it’s all right
I’ll have a rough one Monday morning
but it’s been a knockdown Saturday night.

My love is dead and buried yonder
Beneath the weeping willow tree
What wrecks my life and makes me wonder
Is because she died for me
   Then lay me down in death beside her
   For she’s all this life to me
   That I may join and e’er caress her
   In a land beyond the sea
Yes she died before I told her
That I loved her true and kind
And that I did not mean to fool her
But she left me to repine
God shall I ever get forgiveness
For the deeds that I have done
And meet up yonder her sweet charming
For I know she did me some

Anywhere the wind blows
thats the way your heart goes
There is no warmth or fireside glow
to keep your love at home
Seems like anybody knows
enough to keep your loved ones home
yet you’re still a rolling stone
spending too much time alone
Those lovers living far away
only hear the words you want to say
They don’t make you get inside that place
you kept locked up for so long
what if someone thanks you everyday
took the best and worst and still she stayed
would you tend that garden come what may
or would you still find something wrong
Anyway…..
If absence makes your heart grow fonder
maybe even more you’ll want to wander
’cause time stands still when you’re around her
and the real world rushes in
but if absence makes your heart grow colder
then you’re gonna cry on my shoulder
and think of things you might have told her
and sweet things that might have been
Anyway..…

There’s a chimney so tall That says “Aragon Mill”
But there’s no smoke at all Comin’ out of the stack
For the mill has pulled out And they ain’t comin’ back 
   And the only sound I hear is the sound of the wind
   As it blows through the town, weave and spin, weave and spin. 
There’s no children at all In the narrow, empty streets
Since the looms have all gone It’s so quiet I can’t sleep.
Now I’m too old to change And I’m too young to die
And there’s no place to go For my woman and I. 
Now the mill has closed down It’s the only sound I know
Tell me where will I go? Tell me where will I go?

I remember well the love we once knew
We parted now and strayed from each other
But somehow I can’t help wondering about you
   
    Are you alone with a memory
    Haunted by dreams of the past
    Just waiting for someone to tell you
    You’re playing a game that won’t last
Last night I was dreamin about you
I thought you were back here with me
I prayed that you’d stay here forever
Too soon I realized it couldn’t be
Someday when your love here is faded
And we meet on that highway with no end
We’ll stroll hand in hand there forever
In a land where our love can bloom again

Oh once upon a time in Arkansas
An old man sat in his little cabin door
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
A jolly old tune that he played by ear

   He sawed away at the popular air
   Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
   That didn’t seem to bother the old man at all
A traveler was riding by that day
And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
But the old man still didn’t seem to fret
So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
You’d better mend your roof said he
But the old man said as he played away
I couldn’t mend it now it’s a rainy day
The traveler replied that’s all quite true
But this I think is the thing for you to do
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
Then patch the old roof till it’s good and tight
   But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
   And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
   Get along said he for you give me a pain
   My cabin never leaks when it doesn’t rain

You said you could live without love dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill
I’ve waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real
‘Cause I know you are living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill
The lights shine bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you’re alone with your pride dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill

There’s folks building homes as sweet as can be
They’re levelling their yards and planting their trees
But my little hut I’ll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
   A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
   A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
   Built by my Lord beyond Calvary
   But my little hut I’ll just let it be
   Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
Each day I am getting more ready to go
He’s cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I’m packing my troubles I’m bound with his love
Get ready to move to Heaven above
To you who have homes in this world below
Driving fine cars wherever you go
There’s coming a time when we’ll all pass away
Get ready to move with me on that day

In a quiet country village stood a maple on the hill
Where I sat with my Geneva long ago
As the stars were shining brightly we could hear the whippoorwill
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
We would sing love songs together when the birds had gone to rest
We would listen to the murmur o’er the hill
Will you love me, little darling as you did those starry nights
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
Don’t forget me, little darling when they lay me down to die
Just one little wish, my darling, that I pray
As you linger there in sadness thinking darling of the past
Let your teardrops kiss the flowers on my grave
I will soon be with the angels on that bright and peaceful shore
Even now I hear them coming o’er the hill
So goodbye, my little darling It is time for us to part
I must leave you ‘neath the maple on the hill

Oh I left her in the mountains in the golden summertime
I told her not to worry little darling pal of mine
I told her that I loved her and always would be true
When the moon comes o’er the mountain I’ll be waitin’ there for you
She’s my darling she’s my sweetheart she’s the one for me
With a heart as pure as gold and in dreams her face I see
Soon I’ll be returning and the wedding bells will chime
And I’ll make her mine forever when it’s maple sugar time
Jerry Tuckett will play the fiddle folks will come from miles away
To the maple sugar hoedown what a happy wedding day
I’ll be a country king and I’ll paint a pretty scene
I’ll kiss her smiling ruby lips she’ll be my maple sugar Queen

We started out from Bern one sunny August morn
There was just the four of us against the Matterhorn
There was Albert the Australian and John the Irishman
Me and Bill from Britain, mad dogs in the sun
   Matterhorn, Matterhorn
   Men have tried and men have died to climb the Matterhorn
   That mighty Matterhorn
Two miles up we lost John and our rations fell below
Now Al and Bill are lying beneath an avalanche of snow
Now here I am alone and I know I cannot stop
Two more yards in front of me before I reach the top
Now here I am a dying upon the Matterhorn
Not a thing for me to lie in or a thing to keep me warm
The Queen would surely knight me if I could get back down
But it’s closer here to heaven than it is back to the ground

Was on the high high holy day
The very best day in the year
Little Matty Groves had gone to church
Holy words for to hear
Holy words for to hear
The first to come down was dressed in red
And the second one dressed in green
The third to come down was Lord Daniel’s wife
As fair as any queen
Just as fair as any queen
Then Matty Groves says to one of his men
See the fair one dressed in white
Although she is Lord Daniel’s wife
I’ll be with her tonight
I’ll be with her tonight
Well the little foot page was standing by
And heard every word that was said
He says Lord Daniel shall know tonight
Before I go to bed
Before I go to bed
He had 15 miles for to go that night
And 10 of them he run
He run til he come to the broke down bridge
Then he bent to his breast and swum
He bent to his breast and swum
He swum til he come to where the grass was green
He took to his feet and he run
He run til he come to Lord Daniel’s Gate
Then he rattled at the bells and they rung
He rattled at the bells and they rung
What news What news Lord Daniel says
What news to me have you brung
Little Matty Groves is in the bed with your wife
And their hearts both beat as one
And their hearts both beat as one
Now if the truth you’ve told to me
A rich man you shall be
But if a lie you’ve told to me
I’ll hang you to a tree
I’ll hang you to a tree
He gathered him up about 50 good men
He done it with a free good will
Then he popped his bugle unto his lips
And he blowed it loud and shrill
He blowed it loud and shrill
I’d better get up said little Matty Groves
I’d better get up and go
I know your husband is a coming home
For I heard his bugle blow
I heard his bugle blow
Lay down lay down my precious one
Lay down and go to sleep
It’s only my father’s shepherd’s horn
And he’s a calling for his sheep
He’s a calling for his sheep
So they laid down together again
And they soon were fast asleep
And when they awoke it was broad daylight
Lord Daniel at their feet
Lord Daniel at their feet
Get up from there your naked man
And put you on some clothes
I never intend for to have it said
That a naked man I slow
That a naked man I slow
Oh give me a chance said little Matty Groves
A chance to fight for my life
For there you have two very fine swords
And me not as much as a knife
And me not as much as a knife
Oh yes I have two very fine swords
And they cost me deep in the purse
You may have the finest one
And I will take the worst
Yes I will take the worst
Then Matty Groves struck the very first lick
And he wounded Lord Daniel sore
Lord Daniel struck the very next lick
And he drove Matty Groves to the floor
He drove Matty Groves to the floor
Then he taken his lady by the hand
And he sat her on his knee
And he says Now which do you love the best
Little Matty Groves or me
Little Matty Groves or me
Very well I like your rosy cheeks
Very well I like your chin
But better I love little Matty Groves
Than you and all of your kin
Than you and all of your kin
You can dig my grave on a pretty green hill
Dig it wide and deep
And put little Matty Groves in my arms
Lord Daniel at my feet
Lord Daniel at my feet

All because I loved no one but you
I gave up my friends I left my home

Now you’re gone our love could never be

I was searching for fortune and fame
I found where the water runs deep from the hills
They call it the medicine springs

It was there that I met a fair maiden
Yellow hair and big eyes of blue
She told me one day she loved only me
That she’d forever be true
That she’d forever be true
Well I wanted the best for my darlin’
But my pockets were empty and bare
My love was so great for that starlett of mine
I took what another man had
I took what another man had
As I sit here alone in this jailhouse
With a letter I can’t hardly read
It said my darlin’ has left this ol’ world
She’s a waitin’ in heaven for me
She’s a waitin’ in heaven for me
Some day I’ll go back to the mountains
Where I’ll spend the rest of my days
And the water that runs frome the side of the hill
Will water her flowery grave
Will water her flowery grave

I’d die any day just for you
I have a ship on the ocean
All lined with silver and gold

This morning found me down and troubled hurting deep inside
And if I thought it might do some good I guess I could have cried
Your memory crept into my heart like a winter morning chill
It chilled my heart my blood ran cold I guess I love you still
I try my best to think of ways to keep your memory still
You left a place in spite of me that time can’t seem to kill
The pieces of my broken heart just never seem to fit
There’s one still missing when I rearrange I guess I love you yet
The snow lays in the trees and turns at night from white to blue
I’m looking to replace a life of dreams I lost with you
Yes I’ll be trying to fill my time so that I’m not alone
But old memories of what used to be cover everything I own

On a dark stormy night the angels called mother
The love that we shred for such a short while
She called us around and told us she’s leaving
Then closing her eyes she went with a smile
   Mother’s at rest in a lonesome old graveyard
   On a hill far away there stands her white tomb
   With the grass covered o’er it seems so neglected
   When the spring season comes sweet flowers will bloom
I’ll never forget the love mother gave us
As children we played around our old home
I know her reward is a mansion in heaven
While children on earth are scattered and gone

   There’s a little lonesome grave yard
   On these tomestones it did say
   On mother’s “gone but not forgotten”
    On dad’s “we’ll meet again someday”
I often go out to the graveyard
Where they laided them down to rest
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He’ll do the rest
Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they’ll dwell with god above
Where they’ll meet there friends and loved ones
And share with all his precious love

There I’ll drink the warm red wine
And I’ll play the lonesome jukebox
For your love is on my mind

Till old grim death comes a-knocking at the door
I’m a Methodist till I die
Well they all go there just to have a big time
And to eat their grub so sly
Have applesauce butter and sugar in the gourd
And a great big Methodist pie
Well you ought to hear the ringing when they all get to singin’
That good old bye and bye
See Jimmy McGee in the top of a tree
Saying  how is this for high
Then they all join hands and dance around a ring
Just a singin’ all the while
You’d think it was a cyclone coming through the air
You could hear shout a half a mile
Then a bell brings loud and the great big crowd
Breaks ranks and up they fly
While I took hold of the sugar in the gourd
And I cleaned up the Methodist Pie

Tis the home of my dear parents now above

In silence there my head she’d rest
And press me to her loving breast
Oh Willy don’t go back to sea
There’s other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don’t go where the bullets fly
The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other’s bride
But still my thoughts will sometimes stray
To thee when thou are far away
I never have proved false to thee
The heart I gave was true as thine
But you have proved untrue to me

My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine

Dear wife I found a model church
And worshipped there today
It made me think of the good old times
Before my hair was gray
   The meetinghouse was finer built
   Than they were years ago
   But I found out when I went in
   It was not built for show
The sexton did not sit me down
Away back by the door
He knew that I was old and deaf
And saw that I was poor
   He must have been a Christian man
   He led me boldly through
   The long aisle of that crowded church
   To find a pleasant pew
I wish you’d heard the singing, wife
it had the old town ring
The preacher said with trumpet voice
Let all the people sing
   Oh Coronation was the tune
   The music upward roared
   I thought I heard the angel choir
   Strike on their harps of gold
I tell you wife it did me good
To sing those hymns once more
I felt just like some wrecked marine
Who gets a glimpse of shore
   It made want to lay aside
   This weather beaten form
   And anchor in that blessed port
   Forever from the storm
Dear wife the toil will soon be o’er
The victory soon be won
The shining strand is just ahead
Our race is nearly run
   We’re near to Canaan’s happy shore
   Our hopes are bright and fair
   Thank God we’ll never sin again

There’ll be no sorrow there
In heaven above
Where all is love
There’ll be no sorrow there

A mother went out to a party
She left at home her baby son
He cried and begged her not to leave him
But she would not give up her fun
   She kissed his cheek and tried to soothe him
   But would not heed his childish plea
   She heard him call as she was leaving
   Please mommy please stay home with me
The mother joined the merrymakers
And soon was lost in trifling joy
The mellow tunes and flitting shadows
Made her forget her baby boy
   She danced and laughed and did some drinking
   The world for her was full of glee
   But now and then these words would haunt her
   Please mommy please stay home with me
She left the party feeling dizzy
The smell of drink was on her breath
She hurried home to find her baby
In raging pain and nearing death
   The doctor came and looked on sadly
   The case was hopeless, he could see
   The baby died, these words repeating
   Please mommy please stay home with me
The mother now, her life would forfeit
To hear her baby’s voice again
She grieved to think she rudely left him
To satisfy her wicked vein
   Now mothers don’t neglect your duty
   This story should a lesson be
   Do not ignore your baby’s pleading
   Please mommy please stay home with me

   I got money, marbles, and chalk sweetheart
   But I still feel like I am poor
   Cause my money won’t spend, and my marbles won’t roll
   And my chalk won’t write anymore
There’s an old saying that’s been all around
I heard it before I could walk
How some’s got wealth, some’s got health
Others money marbles and chalk
While you were here I was happy and gay
Your presence made me feel so proud
But you left me, for another one day
Now I feel alone in a crowd
Money, marbles, and chalk is alright
For a miser who loves only gold
But give me a chance, to save our romance
For I love you with all of my soul

For many long years I played the lone hand
I rode my horse in many strange lands
Until one day I stopped for awhile
For two blue eyes and sunny smile
So howl away you old coyote
I hear your sad and lonesome song
‘a calling me back to old Montana
Back to those hills where I belong
One day I rode away from home
I’m a traveling back but it won’t be long
I’ll see you again in a little while
You’re my darling sweet my sunny smile

I’ve been a moonshiner for many long years
I spend all of my money on whiskey and beer

I’ll sell you a gallon for a two dollar bill.
I’ll eat when I’m hungry and I’ll drink when I’m dry
If whiskey don’t kill me Lord I’ll live ’til I die.
God bless them moonshiners they’re all friends of mine
Their breath is a sweet as the dew on the vine.
I’ll go down in some grocery and I’ll drink with my friends
No women to bother me or see what I spend
God bless them pretty women I wish one was mine
For their breath is more sweeter than even moonshine.
God bless that pretty woman I wish she was mine
For her breath is more sweeter than even moonshine.

You start to pray to god above

It starts with just a careless flirt

The night Mother died it broke my Daddy’s heart
In anguish he bowed his gray head
And the pitiful way he kept calling her name
I can’t believe my angel is dead
The sparkle that once shined in my Daddy’s eyes
And the spring he once had in his walk
Was replaced with a far away look on his face
As often of my sweet Mother we’d talk
Then the night finally came I was called to his side
On his face was a heavenly smile
Then he reached for my hand and said Son with a smile
In heaven I’ll see our sweet angel tonight

While kneeling by her beside in a cottage on the hill
My mother prayed her blessing for me there
She was talking then with Jesus while everything was still
And I heard my mother call my name in prayer
   Yes I heard my mother call my name in prayer
   She was pouring out her heart to Jesus there
   Then I gave my heart to Him and He saved my soul from sin
   For I heard my mother call my name in prayer
She was anxious for her boy to be just what he ought to be
And she asked the lord to take Him in His care
Just the worlds I can’t remember but I know she prayed for me
For I heard my mother call my name in played
Then I gave my heart to Jesus and I’m living now for him
And someday I’ll go and meet him in the air
For he heard my mother praying and he saved my soul from sin
Yes he heard my mother call my name in prayer

One night while the moon from heaven was shining
My mother was praying for me to come home
She asked her dear lord watch o’er me out yonder
To send me back home to never more roam
When I left my old home way back in the mountains
I said I’d return with honor and fame
But a young reckless heart turned wrong at the crossroads
And now as I go home I bring mother shame
When I got to the place where I spent my childhood
The silvery moon was shining so bright
When I asked my dear friends to tell me of mother
They said she was called on to heaven last night
She told them of how she was longing to see me
How lonely her home since I went away
Said darling repent and ask for forgiveness
And meet mother there in heaven some day
Mother has gone to live with the angels
Her soul is at rest around the great throne
Now I have no one left here to advise me
For mother no longer awaits me at home

If had such a sweet smelling pew
But to her surprise when she had it analyzed

For there was no one to drown my tears.
But I’ve tried not to blame you

All I can do now is wish you well
But if you should need a friend
I’ll be there until the end
Just don’t ask me to love you again.

So I’ll stick around to see what happens next
When I was younger, my slippers were red
I could kick up my heels right over my head
When I was older my slippers were blue
But still I could dance the whole night thru
Now I am old, my slippers are black
I huff to the store and I puff my way back
But never you laugh, I don’t mind at all
I’d rather be huffing than not puff at all
I get up each morning and dust off my wits
Open the paper and read the obits
If I’m not there, I know I’m not dead
So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed

The day’s are so lonely without you by my side
You told me that you loved me but I guess that you lied
If you could see me here sittin’ all alone
You’d think of the love we shared and come back home
Forget that I love you forget that I cried
Leave every memory of me behind
If it’s all over please tell me that it’s true
But darling my heart can’t stop loving you
I waited so long to find a new love
And I know that time will heal my broken heart
But still there’s a thing or two I cannot forget
Just like those words of love that said we never would part

   Just to know you’re mine until the end of time
   Makes my heart skip a beat
Well I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right then I never could forget you
You are my every dream come true
Well you came into my life without a warning
Turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You’re my sunshine that comes up every morning
You are my every dream come true

In the distant state of Texas
By the silver Rio Grande
Strolled a couple out one evening
Was two sweethearts hand in hand
Was a rich man’s pretty daughter
And the lad she loved so dear
Though tomorrow they must part for many a year
   My heart’s tonight in Texas
   Though I’m far across the sea
   The band is playing Dixie
   And that’s where I long to be
   Dad says the earl I’ll marry
   But although here is my hand
   My heart’s tonight in Texas
   By the silver Rio Grande
To Europe she was going
To become a lady grand
For her father hoped an
Earl of course she’ll wed
But she went away next morning
And her heart was true to Jack
A letter came one day and this it read
At a stately ball in England
Stood the Texas lass one night
The scenes were all splendid
And the light were dizzyingly bright
The earl knelt beside her
Asking her to be his bride
But her thoughts were by the silver Rio Grande

Got a home in the hills of old Virginia I love still
And it stands near the lonesome pines
And I long to go back to the vine covered shack
Where I left that old mother of mine 
I can still see her there in that old rocking chair
In my home among the hills
And I seem to hear her say why did you go away
From your home among the hills
The pine trees stand alone near my old Virginia home
And that silver hared mother of mine
I can see her smiling face in that old familiar place
In my home among the hills
I’m leaving here today I’m going back to stay
In my home among the hills
How happy we will be near the lonesome pine trees
In my home among the hills

As the sun stretched over the sky
Stood a man with his hands tied behind him
Awaiting his sentence to die
The birds hushed their singing at daybreak
For Christ had his place to fulfill
From a lovely bright mansion in Heaven
To away on a lonely dark hill
They made him walk that Calvary
He had to drink the bitter cup
One could hear hammers ring in the stillness
Then the soldiers they lifted him up

And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
We stood behind our cotton bales and didn’t say a thing

If we didn’t fire a musket ’til we looked ’em in the eyes
We held our fire ’til we seen their faces well
We opened up our squirrel guns and really gave ’em
Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where the rabbits couldn’t go
They ran so fast the hounds couldn’t catch ’em
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We fired our cannon ’til the barrel melted down
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

Be good to my little baby girl
She’s all I got left in this old world
She’s warm and she’s sweet
Lord she means the world to me
Be good to my little baby girl.
Her eyes light up when I mention your name
Lately she smiles all the time
She needs someone strong who won’t do her wrong
I’m hoping that you’ll be the kind.
I can see her as a child sittin’ on her mama’s knee
Sometimes I think I failed her back then
‘Cause I was runnin’ wild I was always runnin”round
I never was the dad I should have been.
She told you of her past of the ones that done her wrong
You know her heart’s been broken in two
She deserves some happiness and she thinks you’re the best
I believe her so I’m counting on you.

Look deep inside your heart and answer truly

Fell right down on the floor

I started gathering flowers to make a sweet bouquet
Each flower that I gathered. each one played a part

   Picking the colours that’ll never fade away
   Each flower has a meaning so dear to me
   Each flower is a treasure chestof sweet memories 
Violets for my sweetheart, a white rose for my dad
A red rose stood for mother, the best friend that I had
Forget-me-nots stood faithfully for tried true friends of mine
Daisies for the puppy loves that I left far behind 
Lilies are for grandma, who watches from afar
Poppies are for brother, who lost his life at war

A rainbow full of colours that will never fade away

Pretty eyes she had you ought-a seen

I saw it all and yet I was so blind
We wound up in her part of town
Bright lights with our music all around
I gazed into her eyes and she in mine
She had me in a trance it was so fine
Now I cry cry cry
I can’t get over her though I try
I’m blue blue blue
I should have known she never could be true
Well I find as the night has faded on
I found your house the neighbors say your gone
The girl she don’t live here anymore
Oh the pain to me that lies in store
So all I have is a picture in a frame
She disappeared the same way she came
She made a wreck of me and I find
She’s out of sight but always on my mind

Two old friends shared a room in a home for the elderly
Confined to their beds their bodies giving way
Old Joe lay by the window and watched the day go by
And Bill lived to hear him tell about the world outside
They shared with each other the stories of their lives
And relived all their memories and dreams of a better time
Outside the leaves were changing, summer turned to fall
And from the bed by the window old Joe described it all
   From, the bed by the window he’d tell how the children played
   The lovers in the park, the ducks out on the lake
   The little boy swept the sidewalk when the sun came up each day
   From the bed by the window he told it just that way
On a cold winter morning in the light of the dawn
The bed by the window was empty old Joe had passed and gone
They moved Bill by the window he couldn’t hold back the tears
He’d finally see the view outside after all these years
   From the bed by the window he couldn’t see out at all
   There was nothing out that window but an old brick wall
A new friend shares a room in a home for the elderly
Confined to his bed his body has given way
Now Bill lay by the window as the days go by
And his new friend left to hear him tell about the world outside
   From, the bed by the window he’d tell how the children played
   The lovers in the park, the ducks out on the lake
   The little boy swept the sidewalk when the sun came up each day
   From the bed by the window he told it just that way

The weather finally broke in the middle of april
Jacob loaded up his wagon with last years furs.
He’d have to make the trip alone ’cause it would be too risky
For his pretty wife sarah and the unborn child she carried with her.
It took three weeks to reach the mississippi ribbon
And he turned south toward new orleans
For a boy from the mountains it was easy to get caught up
In the sights and sounds of the city
And the things he’d never seen.
   And the river rolls on Like an endless river
   The sun light glistens on the rocks below
   He can hear her voice in the rippling water
   Saying please be home before the cold winds blow.
He fell in With a bad companion
Said give me your money or I’ll take your life
Jacob drew his pistol and in less than a heart beat
The stranger lay dead on the floor and someone had to pay the price.
And after three long years in a Louisiana prison
He stands on the hill that overlooks his farm
With his woman by his side thanks god for his blessings
And most of all for the blonde hair child resting in his arms.

Twas in St Louis city where I first saw the light
Brought up by honest parents on a pathway of right
I was left on orphan at the age of ten years
On mother’s grave I shed many tears
I’d scarcely reached manhood when I left my old home
With some other fellows to the west we did roam
Seeking employment though scarcely could find
We seemed so poor and the people unkind
Was in New York City where we first met our fate
We were arrested while roaming the streets
The charges were burglars the theft it was called
But they said it would place us behind the stone walls
We were marched next morning to the courthouse for trial
My pal was downhearted so I gave him a smile
We pleaded for mercy but was shown none at all
They gave us twenty years behind the stone walls
We were handcuffed next morning and marched to the pen
We arrived there at midnight with a few other men
The doors were thrown open we marched in the halls
Just learn to be a convict behind the stone walls
While lying that night on a pallet of straw
I swore I would never again break the law
There’s none but your mother to bear your downfall
When you are a convict behind the stone walls
Come all you young fellows and listen to me
When you lose life’s pleasures you’ve lost liberty
I’ve tasted life’s pleasures it’s bitter than gall
It’ll lead to a cell behind the stone wall

Stop here son there’s something you should see

The tall pines wavin’ in the breeze the air was clear and fresh
That Georgia winter sunshine was warmin’up my back
And I saw the train comin’ down the track
   God came thru Bellville Georgia
   He was ridin’ on the noon-day train
   It’s all power to Him and praise His holy name
   He never got off of the train
   He never got off of the train.
I’ve never had a day like that since I have been alive
My body full of feelin’ there was vision in my eyes
I’ve traveled this world over just to meet that certain train
And I knew my life will never be the same
Well I don’t know where He’s goin’ but I know He likes to ride
Across the hills and valleys through the prairies thru the skies
And I know the time is comin’ if the world don’t ever change
Everybody’s got to meet that train.

Twice as strong as any ox

Where the handouts grow on bushes and you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars are all empty and the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees
Where the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains all the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth and the hens lay soft boiled eggs
The farmer’s trees are full of fruit and the barns are full of hay
Oh, I’m bound to go where there ain’t no snow
Where the rain don’t fall and the wind don’t blow

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol come a-trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats and the railroad bulls are blind
There’s a lake of stew and of whiskey too
You can paddle all around ’em in a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains the jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out again as soon as you are in
There ain’t no short handled shovels, no axes saws or picks

Wish they’d bring him back
He chased the big hogs through the fence
And the little ones through the crack
Met a possum in the road
Blind as he could be
Jumped the fence and whipped my dog
And bristled up at me
Once I had an old gray mule
His name was Simon Slick
He’d roll his eyes and back his ears
And how that mule would kick
How that mule would kick
He kicked with his dying breath
He shoved his hind feet down his throat
And kicked himself to death

Billy Grey rode into Gantry, back in ’83
There he did meet young Sarah McRae
The wild rose of morning, that pale flower of dawning
Herald of springtime in his young life that day. 
Sarah she could not see the daylight of reality
In her young eyes Billy bore not a flaw
Knowing not her chosen one was a hired gun
Wanted in Kansas City by the law. 
Then one day a tall man came riding ‘cross the badlands
Lying to the North of New Mexico
He was over her to say he was lookin’ for Bill Grey
A ruthless man and a dangerous outlaw. 
Well, the deadly news came creepin’ to Billy fast sleeping
There in the Claredon bar and hotel
He fled toward the old church, there on the outskirts
Thinkin’ he’d climb to that old steeple bell. 
But a rifle ball came flying, face down he lay there dying
There in the dust of the road where he fell
Sara she ran to him just cursing the law man
Accepting no reason knowin’ he was killed. 
Sarah lives in that same old white frame house
Where she first met Billy some fifty years ago
And wild rose of morning she’s faded with the dawning
For each day of sorrow the long years have sown. 
And written on the stone where the dusty winds have long blown
Eighteen words to a passing world say
“True love knows no season, no rhyme nor no reason
Justice is cold as the Cranger County clay.” 
Yes . . . true love knows no season . . . .

I’ll sing you a true song of Billy the Kid
I’ll sing of the reckless deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time ago
When a man’s only friend was his own forty-four
When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out in the west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man
Fair Mexico maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Now here is young manhood that reached its sad end
He’d notch on his pistol for twenty-one men
Now ’twas on the same night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends:”I’m not satisfied
It’s twenty-one men that I’ve put bullets through
And sherriff Pat Garrett’s gonna make twenty-two”
Now this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The poor outlaw’s life had reached its sad end
Now this is the true song of Billy the Kid
These were the reckless deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time ago
When a man’s only friend was his own forty-four
There’s many a fine boy with a face fine and fair
Who starts out in life with a chance to be square
But just like poor Billy he wanders astray
Then he loses his life in the very same way

Last night the pale moon was shining
Last night when all was still
I wandered alone in sadness
Out among the woodland hills
I heard the birds a-singing
Out among the trees and views
And every bird, my darling
Was singing, was singing of you
   Was singing, singing of you, my love
   Was singing, was singing of you
   And every bird, my darling
   Was singing, was singing of you
I think of you in the daytime
I dream of you at night
I wake and wish you were here, love,
And tears are blinding my sight
The flowers that slumber so sweetly
The stars above the blue
Oh heaven itself, my darling
Is thinking, is thinking of you
I open my window so gently
And look on the dreamy view
The world itself, my darling
Is sighing, is sighing for you

On the bitter green she walked the hills above the town
Echo to her footsteps as soft as ider down
Waiting for her master to kiss away the tears
Waitin’ through the years
Bitter Green they called her walkin’ in the sun
Lovin’ everyone that she me
Bitter Green they called her waitin’ in the sun
Waitin’ for someone to take her home
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea
Some say he was a prison’r who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist
Dreamin’ of a kiss
But now that bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger his tears fall in the dust
Knealin’ by the churchyard in the autumn mist
Deamin’ of a kiss

But I’m comin’ home to Black eyed Susie

Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall

All I want in this creation
Pretty little wife on a big plantation.

Two little boys to call me Pappy.
One name Sop and the other name Gravy
One sop it up and the other gonna save it.
Up Red Oak and down salt water
Some old man gonna lose his daughter.

Came home late and took a lickin’.
Love my wife and love my baby
Love my biscuits sopped in gravy.
Goin’ back home with a pocket full of money
Somebody there to call me honey.

I was standin’ by the road in Black Jack County.
Not knowing that the Sheriff paid a bounty,
For men like me who didn’t have a penny to their name.
He locked my legs in 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
All we had to eat was bread and water,
Everyday we had to build his road a mile and a quarter,
A Black Snake Whip would sting our backs if some poor fool complained,
But we couldn’t fight back wearing 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
Then one night while the Sheriff lay a sleepin’,
We all gathered round him slowly creepin’,
Heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain,
When we beat him to death wearing 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
The wounds have all healed and I am thankful,
And there’s nothing left but scars around my ankle.
But best of all no man will ever be a slave again,
To a Black Snake Whip and 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
But best of all no man will ever be a slave again,

How old are you my honey
Answered him with a philly and a smile
I’ll be sixteen next Sunday, be sixteen next Sunday 
Come go with me my pretty little miss
Come go with me my honey
I’ll take you across the deep blue sea
Where you never shall want for money, never shall want for money 
She pulled off her high heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
She put on her low heeled shoes
And they both went off together, both went off together

As time draws near my dearest dear when you and I must part
How little you know of the grief and woe in my poor aching heart
Each night I suffer for your sake, you’re the girl I love so dear
I wish that I was going with you or you were staying here 
I wish my breast were made of glass wherein you might behold
Upon my heart your name lies wrote in letters made of gold
In letters made of gold my love, believe me when I say
You are the one that I will adore until my dying day 
The blackest crow that ever flew would surely turn to white
If ever I prove false to you bright day will turn to night
Bright day will turn to night my love, the elements will mourn
If ever I prove false to you the seas will rage and burn
 
And when you’re on some distant shore think of your absent friend
And when the wind blows high and clear a light to me pray send
And when the wind blows high and clear pray send your love to me
That I might know by your hand light how time has gone with thee

With a draw from either hand
I was known as Blackie’s gunman
The best two gunman in the land
I could shoot the ace of diamonds
With the dice I had no equal
Some of them are with us now
Most of them are sadly sleeping
Neath the weeping willow bough
Many a cowboy’s game I’ve played in
Left that night with all their gold
As a sport I was broken
As a sport I let it go
I once loved a girl named Nellie
How we loved no tongue can tell
But I know I’ll never meet her
Oh it was hard to say farewell
Her eyes were like the deep blue water
And her hair was golden curls
And her cheeks were golden velvet
And her teeth were snow white pearls
Together we lived in a cottage
And our life it was a dream
And the angels they watched o’er us
Made our life one happy dream

I remember the ways and the bygone days
When we were all in our prime
How us and John L. we gave the old man hell
Down in the Blue Diamond Mine
When the whistle blowed and the rooster crowed
Two hours before daylight
When a man done his best and he earned a good rest
And had seventeen dollars at night
   In the mines in the mines
   In the Blue Diamond Mines
   I’ve worked my (whole-1*) (poor-2*) (– -3*) life away
   In the mines in the mines
   In the Blue Diamond Mine
   Go fall on your knees and pray.
You old black gold you’ve taken my lungs
And your dust has darkened my home
And now that we’re old you’re turning your back
But where else can an old miner go
It’s  Algoma Block and it’s Big Leatherwood
And now it’s Blue Diamond too
The pits they are closing get another job
But what else can an old miner do
John L. had a dream but it’s broken it seems
And the union is letting us down
Last night they took away my hospital card
Saying why don’t you leave this old town.
So I’ll go downtown and I’ll hang around
And maybe it ain’t so bad
But when you get home your kids will meet you at the door
Saying what did you bring me dad

He was just a blue eyed Boston boy his voice was low with pain
I’ll do your bidding, comrade mine if you will do the same
But if you should ride and I should fall you’ll do as much for me
While mother at home is awaiting the news so write to her tenderly 
She’s waiting at home like a patient saint her pale face filled with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am dead I’ll see her face no more
Just then the order came to charge for a moment hand touched hand
They answered aye and on they rode that brave and devoted band 
Straight way was the course to the top of the hill and the Rebels with shot and shell
Plowed furrows of death midst the toiling ranks and guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying sound from the heights they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared rode slowly back again 
But among the dead at the top of the hill lay the boy with the golden hair
And the tall dark man who rode by his side lay still beside him there
There was none to write to the blue-eyed girl the words her lover had said
While mother at home is awaiting her boy she’ll only find he’s dead 
While mother at home is awaiting her boy she’ll only find he’s dead

   Far away near my Blueridge mountain home
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
In those blue ridge hills far away
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
They are sleeping in peace together there

I’ve been longing for days gone by
When I die won’t you bury me on that old mountain side
Make my resting place upon the hills so high

As another morning settles like the dust behind my heels
In the shadow of a restless soul born on wheels
I’m bound to sing the highway’s in the song.
Now the wandering song within me is a song I’ve learned
When I heard the freight trains whistle and my head was turned
The carefree chorus of that liner as she burned
Now the lineman says you’ve got to move along.
Now I left the years and miles lying where they fell
Among the book my soul was written and the tales my shoes could tell
I left them lying there for someone else to tell
And the road says you’ve got to move along.

And Richmond’s full of hospitality

Said I need you here in Richmond right away
Take the bus I’ll meet you at the station
Bring your clothes ’cause I want you to stay.
My bus pulled in the station late this evening
And there’s no one around this place but me
She must have changed her mind or she’s forgotten
And her name’s not in the phone directory.

And a warm and cozy place to go lie down
Instead of standin’ all alone in Richmond
While the cold Virginia rain is comin’ down.

Met the girl I love in a town way down in Dixie
‘Neath the stars above she was the sweetest girl I ever did see
So I took her in my arms and told her of her many charms
I kissed her while the fiddles played the Bonaparte’s Retreat
   All the world was bright as I held her on that night
   And I heard her say Please don’t ever go away
   So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms
   I kissed her while the fiddles played the Bonaparte’s Retreat

Goodbye my little bonnie blue eyes
Goodbye my little bonnie blue eyes
You’ve told me more lies than the stars in the skies
Goodbye my little bonnie blue eyes
I saw my little bonnie last night
She looked so dear to me
She’s the only girl I ever loved
She’s now gone back on me
Oh stand at the gate and weep
Oh stand at the gate and weep
Oh stand at the gate and weep and morn
Oh bonnie wont you love me once more
Come and lay your hand in mine
Come and lay your hand in mine
Come and lay your arms around my neck
And say that you will be mine
Oh you know what you promised me
Oh you know what you promised me
You promised that you’d marry me
Oh you know what you promised me
I’ve stayed in the country too long
I’ve stayed in the country too long
The only wrong that I have done
I’ve stayed in the country too long
Come and go with me too the train
Come and go with me too the train
Come and go with me and see me get on
Goodbye my little bonnie I’m gone

In the land of Breathed County was raised a crooked man
Made the county dry and the prices high
For the bootleg whiskey man
His age was barely twenty-one, his family was ashamed
They had a son who left his home
For a bootleg whiskey game
   Bootleg John won’t you come on home
   Your family’s all alone
   You’re runnin’ wild and your baby child
   Wants his daddy home
His wife she loved hime dearly tho’ he seldom came around
She’d always cry when he said goodbye
But she never could hold him down
Twelve pistols in his pocket his shotgun on the floor
He made his run to Lexington
To the bootleg whiskey store
His car was full of whiskey, his hand was on his gun
He was set to go but he didn’t know
He was makin’ his last run
The sheriff pulled him over and he shot the lawman down
They locked him well in the county jail
And the jailer slapped him down

Born to lose I’ve lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I’ve always been so blue
Born to lose and now I’m losing you.
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you’re not there
You’ve grown tired and now you say we’re through
Born to lose and now I’m losing you.
Born to lose my every hope is gone
It’s so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I’m losing you.

Coming down from Tennessee riding on the line
Thinking about the girl of mine couldn’t keep from crying
   Honey babe I’m bound to ride
   Don’t you want to go
Riding on a streetcar looking o’er the town
Eating saltine crackers ten cents a pound
Working on a railroad saving all I can
Looking for that woman ain’t got no man
If I die a railroad man bury me under the ties
So I can see old number nine as she goes rolling by
See that train a coming round the bend
Goodbye my little darling I’m on my way again

When it’s decoration day in Heaven
There’s a bouquet I’m longing to see
There’s a flower somewhere in the bouquet
That means all the world to me
Now she left the old homeplace is lonely
Since mother has been called away
And I know I can never more see her

I remember the night the angles called her
To live on that beautiful shore
It left us so lonely here without her
It can never be like home anymore.

And we knew them all by name
   See how the bramble and the rose
   Intertwine

To ourselves and to each other
Without really meaning to
So put your arms around me
And we’ll sing a true love song
And we’ll learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

The same way that I’m leaving you
For love is mainly just memories
And everyone’s got them but few.

   You’re literally just waltzing on air
   It’s a brand new Tennessee waltz
   With no telling who will be there
When I leave it’ll be like I found you love
Descending victorian stairs
I’m feeling like one of your photographs
With not even you left to care.
Have all your passionate violins play
A tune for a Tennessee kid
Who’s feeling like leaving another town
With no place to go if he did.

And when I robbed that cowboy how happy I did feel
And when I robbed that cowboy how happy I did feel
I wore a wide brim high hat my saddle too was fine
And when I courted a pretty girl you’d bet I called her mine

Where I go to kneel and pray

While here on earth we stay
It’s a place to lose your cares and worries
And to leave the load you bear
It’s a stepping stone on the road to glory
There’s a brighter mansion over there
    There’s a brighter brighter mansion a brighter brighter mansion
    In a world that’s free from care
    It’s a home eternal in the Heavens
    There’s a brighter mansion over there
There the Savior standing at God’s right hand
Who will harken to our call
By His sweat and blood on the cross at Calvary
Gave His life for one and all
Now by grace thru faith we attain His mercy
And with beauties we will share
There’s a sacred promise that He made to all
There’s a brighter mansion over there

It seen the joys of my family shared my grief since they’re gone
Kept me dry from the rain weathered many a storm
I’m just an old feeble man now not much father to go
Soon my savior’s gonna call me for He’s often told me so
I’ll just stay in my cabin till I’ve lived my life’s span
And in my Savior’s name I’ll do all that I can

Heard me pray for many people who’s soul thought was lost
Seen me welcome many strangers who needed help on their way
Will see the angels come for me when I’ve lived my last day

All I ever cared to do was ride my pony on

Until I met a Texas girl who stole my heart away
   Where the sleepy Rio Grande goes slowly to the sea

   But the angels they grew jealous of her beauty and her smile
   And came along one stormy night and stole away my bride
   The birds have hushed their singing sadness is over the land

Her cheeks were like the dawn of day that breaks upon the world
She’s gone and left me lonely I miss the touch of her hand
Tonight while I am walking by the sleepy Rio Grande

Provided for me well
Twas in the city of Lanson Town
They placed me in a mill
It was there I spied a pretty fair miss
On whom I cast my eye

And she believed a lie
Three weeks ago last Saturday night
Of course it was the day
The devil put it in my mind
To take her life away
I went into her sisters house
At eight o’clock one night
But little did the sister ? think
On her I had my spite
I asked her if she’d take a walk
With me a little ways
That she and I might have a talk
About our wedding day
We walked along until we came
To my little desert place
I grabbed a stick off of the fence
And struck her in the face
I run my fingers through her coal black hair
To cover up my sin
I drug her to the river side
And there I plunged her in
I started back unto my mill
I met my servant John
He asked me why I was so pale
And it so very warm
Come all young men and warning take
Unto your lovers be true

Time forgets these bitter things I feel
But your days are numbered

When you finally play a heart that plays for real
There’s a new fool somewhere waiting
For you old fashioned heart-break love affair
He’ll see through your intentions
with each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new somewhere
Leavin’ was so easy
but old hands do make fancy moves
Enough for one fell victim to your game
But someday you’ll see
that cold hearts can be broken too
And what goes ’round must come around your way

Night
While everyone is sleeping
Night
These memories have got me weeping
Pretty soon
Daylight will come creeping
Daylight
When I’ll be just as lonely
Daylight
And I’ll be thinking of you only
Night will come
Once again my past will haunt me
Cry
Every night the same old story
Talkin
To my heart but it ignores me
Night
Just darkness before me
Night
Uh-huh
Night
Huh-huh

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, Buddy for my size
   Roll on buddy, don’t you roll so slow
   How can I roll, when the wheels won’t roll
I’m going to the mountain, just to see my baby
And I ain’t coming back, no I ain’t coming back 
There ain’t one hammer, down in this tunnel
That can ring like mine, that can ring like mine
   Rings like silver, shines like gold
   Rings like silver, shines like gold
This old hammer, it killed John Henry
Ain’t gonna kill me, ain’t gonna kill me
It’s a long way to Harlan, and a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little booze, just to get a little booze
Buddy when I’m log gone, won’t you make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal, out of number nine coal

There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold
But one was out on the hills away
Far off from the gates of gold
Away on the mountains wild and bare
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care
Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine
Are they not enough for Thee
But the Shepherd made answer tis this of Mine
Has wandered away from Me
Although the road be rough and steep
I go to the desert to find My sheep
I go to the desert to find My sheep
But all through the mountains thunder-riven
Up from the rocky steep
There arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven
Rejoice I have found My sheep
And the angels echoed around the throne
Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own
Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own

My mother was crying when I left my chair
The sentence were sharp for it cut like a knife
For ninety nine years folks is almost for life
I dreamed of the whistle I heard the bells ring
My sweetheart was coming some good news to bring
I knew that she loved me and that she’d be true
She said she would save me I’m guilty as you
She went for a pardon or else for parole
I know she’ll come back for she’s part of my soul
If she ever fails me I’ll be mighty blue
I’ll stay in this jailhouse I’ll die in here too
They said I was a criminal and to my despair
They sent me to Nashville and shaved off my hair
So come hear my story I’ll tell you my fate
I’m serving in Nashville for another man’s hate
I just got a letter from Nashville town
And after I read it my spirit broke down
It’s sad that my sweetheart and the judge would be wed
And here in this jailhouse I wish I was dead
No matter how right folks a man he may be
Bad company will send him to prison like me
So take a good woman and make her your wife

Well I can’t be something that I’m not
We can’t stoke a fire that we ain’t got

And we courted where the wild bananas waved
For long years there we courted
And we were as happy as one
And my hard work for did Massey
And the happiness of life had just begun
   No more the moon shines on Lorena
   As we’d sit and watch the coons among the corn
   And the possums laying on the wild bananas
   And the old owl a hootin like a horn
One day I called to see my dear Lorena
I thought she would meet me at the gate
But they took her away to old Virginy
And left me to mourn for her fate
For years I have longed to see her
And the thoughts of her was ever in my head
One day Massey read me a letter
Telling me the Lorena she was dead
But I know that her soul has gone to heaven
And there she is ever free from pain
And to her a brighter crown is given
And no more she will wear the darkie’s chain

Old Bill Jones was a son of a gun
When he got a drink or two
He’d hug the boys and kiss the girls.
He’d kiss their babies too
He lived on a trail that was easy to foller
Way down yonder in Moonshine Holler
He loved his fiddle and he loved his fun
And he loved his mountain dew
Old Bill Jones was a son of a gun
When he got a drink or two
They had a big meetin on the Cumberland Crag
And the people gathered in
The preacher preached till his tongue couldn’t wag
But he couldn’t stop their sin’
When old Bill came to give his greetin’
They all got happy and had a big meetin’
Well old Bill run for sheriff
Against the Prohibition men.
He swore he’d drink the country dry
If the folks would put him in.
I t almost tickled the Wets to death
When the Drys got drunk on old Bill’s breath.
Old Bill went a-courtin’
And his girl got mad and said
Bill Jones, I would not marry you
If all the rest were dead!
He slipped some whiskey in her coffee cup
And she was Mrs. Jones when she woke up.
Liner note says–
I knew this old Bill Jones since I was a boy
and if anything
this song I
wrote
about him is an understatement. He was the kind of man who would do anything
for his friends–and anything to his enemies–and was only afraid of two
things
the rattlesnake and the wild hog. Soon after I met him
he traded his saddle
mule for a Model T and became a “son-of-a-gun on wheels.” His wild days
over
he married
settled down
and raised a family. He studied at night school
and
became a lawyer
then a wise
respected judge. He was to give many a
suspended
sentence to young cutups–fellows like he used to be.

Way down in old Kentucky boys on one winter’s morn
In eighteen forty-seven Old Bill Miner was born
But nothing ever suited Bill at least that’s what they say
And at the age of thirteen years one night he ran away
 
From ranch to California ranch he did his life enjoy
When asked his occupation there he would reply cowboy
With a rocky mountain highway man Bill LeRoy some say
They robbed until LeRoy was hung and old Bill got away
 
In Turkey and in London ‘twas there he could be free
A desert raider a slave trader he soon became you see
Running guns in Rio and South Americae
Then robbing trains in the diamond fields of old North Africae
 
    Hands up boys hold them steady the usual command
    From old Bill Miner the gentleman bandit a six gun in his hand
    Robbing trains all his life he would often say
    Ain’t no jail that can hold me I’ll surely get away
    Oh I’ll surely get away
 
Back home in California he robbed the Sonora state
San Quentin prison and twenty years brought him the middle age
And they let him out for being good in nineteen hundred one
The twentieth century was young he bought himself a gun
 
Upon that mainline CPR he stopped the fast mail train
Got a life in New Westminster Bin in the ol’ Victoria rain
But Bill was good to his word and knew what he was about
Thirty-five feet of tunnel in nineteen seven he dug out
 
 
Head wide so? for Georgia in a manner grand and slow
He robbed the southern rail express his hair was white as snow
Caught by W.A. Minster that persistent Pinkerton man
Tell me now just who you are was his gruff command
 
I am G.W.Edwards a-standing in the mud
George Anderson William Miner or maybe old Bill Mud
Bill broke out of the Georgia bin in the swampy waist-deep water
They hunted him down with dogs and guns for three miles and a quarter
 
And way down south in Milledgeville no hope for a pardon
Old Bill tended to the flowers in the penitentiary garden
But sometimes old memories are all that we can keep
And two years later to the day old Bill died in his sleep

I’m just an old black choo-choo
On a rusty railroad track
They put me in the choo-choo graveyard
And they’re never gonna bring me back
They’re pulling my cars with a diesel
And the diesel sure looks proud
But he’ll never make the sound of a choo-choo
When he blows his whistle loud
    There’s many-many little children
    Can never thrill to my choo-choo sound
    If they don’t put me back upon the railroad
    I’ll never keep on chuggin’ around
    So me fa fa fa so la mi so so fa
    So me fa fa fa so la mi so
    So me fa fa fa so la la
    So me fa fa fa so la
My coat was black and shiny
On the day of my trial run
I’ll never forget how they eyed me
As I glistened in the sun
I’ll be the diesel’s helper
If they’ll only set me free
I’ll blow my whistle at the crossing
Make the diesel proud of me
Well, the black smoke rose in the distance
As the diesel roared  on by
But the coalburner kept on a-chuggin’
As he went on down the line
There’s a new day coming tomorrow
When you won’t hear the whistle scream
You’ll just hear the roar of the diesel
Like the foghorn out at sea

Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay
Gone from this earth to the cotton fields away
Gone from the earth to a better land I know
I hear their gentle voices calling, Old Black Joe
    I’m coming, I’m coming, for my head is bending low
    I hear their gentle voices calling, old black Joe
Why do I weep, when my heart should feel no pain
Why do I sigh when my friends come not again
Grieving for forms now departed long ago
I hear their gentle voices calling, Old Black Joe
Where are the hearts once so happy and so free
The children so dear that I held upon my knee
Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go
I hear their gentle voices calling, Old Black Joe

On old Black Mountain, on Saturday night
Mountain boys are doin’ alright
From an old fruit jar they get on the jag
and a hootin’ up a tune called the Black Mountain Rag
Hey, over there’s a pretty little widder
Bet you five bucks that I’m a-gonna git ‘er
Gonna swing her round the corner and her feet won’t lag
When you’re hootin’ up a tune called the Black Mountain Rag
When the caller tips in the middle of the floor
Y’all join hands and circle four
A-la-main left and a-la-main right
Swing your honey and you hold her tight
All join hands and circle the wheel
The more you dance then the better you feel
Swing your honey and her feet won’t lag
When you’re hootin’ up a tune called the Black Mountain Rag
With a homemade fiddle and a shoestring bow
And a little bit of rythm of an old banjo
Give the fiddle a dram, and let it get right
Black Mountain is a rockin’ on Saturday night
Hey, over there’s a pretty little widder
Well I bet you five bucks that I’m a-gonna git ‘er
Gonna swing her round the corner and her feet won’t lag

There’s a place dear to me where I’m longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent
With my friends at the old country church
   Precious years precious years, sweet memory
   Oh what joy they bring to me
   How I long once more to be
   With my friends at the old country church
As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy
As I knelt at the old country church
There with Jesus above in his wonderful love
Saved my soul at the old country church
How I wish that today all the people would pray
As they did at the old country church
If they’d only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As he did at the old country church

Oh my brother take this warning
Don’t let ol Satan take your hand
You’ll be lost in sin forever
You’ll never reach the promised land
   The old crossroads now is waiting
   Which one are you going to take
   One leads down to destruction
   The other to the pearly gate
One road leads up to heaven

He’ll guide you through the old crossroads
Soon your life will be over
You’ll have to face the old crossroads
Will you be ready then my brother
To shun the one down below

Now old Dan Tucker’s fine old man
Washed his face in a fryin’ pan
Combed his head with a wagon wheel
And died with a toothache in his heel
Get out of the way old Dan Tucker
Get out of the way old Dan Tucker
Get out of the way old Dan Tucker
You’re too late to get your supper
Now old Dan Tucker is come to town
Riding a billy goat leading a hound
Hound dog bark and the billy goat jump
Landed Dan Tucker on top of the stump
Now old Dan Tucker he got drunk
Fell in the fire and kicked up a chunk
Red hot coal got in his shoe
And oh my lawd how the ashes flew
Now old Dan Tucker is come to town
Swinging the ladies round and round
First to the right and then to the left
Then to the girl that he loves best

Young devils find love most every night
They lie with their dreams and their arms til daylight
They use love like whiskey, their cares to dissolve
To charm them and warm them but, not to involve
I was a young devil sturdy and proud
I used to laugh often, I used to laugh loud
I laughed when you told me goodbye that last time
I didn’t know how you’d linger on this old devil’s mind
   Old devils dream, all alone it seems
   Old devils dream all alone
   When their devilment is done
   Their wildest races run
   Old devils dream all alone
Young devils find even they must grow old
Love that was always so warm has grown cold
Their sweet things have vanished and sweet dreams have flown
Sleep when it comes finds them sleeping alone

It’s been ten long years since I left my home
In the hollow where I was born
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
And the foxhunter blows his horn
I fell in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a sawmill or two
   What have they done to the old home place
   Why did they tear it down
   And why did I leave the plow in the field
   And look for a job in the town
Well my girl she ran off with somebody else
The taverns took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away
Now the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I’ve lost my love I’ve lost my home
And now I wish that I was dead

And the birds are singing in the trees

That day I left them behind
Oh how my heart does yearn for the day when I’ll return

High on the mountain above the timberline
There lies an old man With a look of death in his eyes
In his one room cabin beside a rocking chair
Lies a hand made fiddle he made with loving care
His hands are weak and trembling his bow is worn and frayed
He thinks of lonesome ballads he’s not strong enough to play
The old man is now in heaven but his fiddle stayed behind
To play a strange and lonesome melody hear it crying through the pines
In his one room cabin beside a rocking chair
Lies a hand made fiddle he made with loving care

Down sat an owl and he said all quiet
Lonesome day and a lonesome night
Thought I heard a pretty girl say
Court all night and you sleep next day
Well then, said the raven as she flew
If I was a young one I’d get two
One for to fetch and the other to sew

He don’t give no “yes, I do”

   And old memories mean nothing to me

So if you don’t love me now set me free
For old memories mean nothing to me
Time has a way of passing by
Over the ruts of our lives it will fly
And if you don’t love me now I can see
And old memories mean nothing to me
I know we once had a fine love
Over others you towered above
But I’m not the playful kind you can see

When I come to find him he’s barkin’ at the moon

He wouldn’t hurt a living thing he was so very kind
One night I saw a big fat coon climb into a tree
I called Ol’ Rattler right away to fetch him down for me
But Rattler wouldn’t fetch for me because he liked that coon
I saw them walking paw in paw later by the light of the moon

Say a prayer and keep on trying

Am I a soldier of the cross
A follower of the lamb
And shall I fear to own His cause
Or blush to speak His name
   On the sea (the sea the sea)
   Of Galilee (of Galilee)
   My Jesus is walking on the sea
   On the sea (the sea the sea)
   Of Galilee (of Galilee)
   My Jesus is walking on the sea
Must I be carried to the sky
On flowery beds of ease
While others false do win the prize
And sail through bloody seas
There shall I take my weary soul
In seas of heavenly rest
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast

The dream of love is over
Today we said goodbye
We parted not in anger
Though tears came in her eyes
Twas just as fate decreed dear
That we must never wed
Yet in her heart she loved me
She married wealth instead
   One little word could change my future life
   One little word could have made her my wife
   Too late too late now my fondest hopes are dead
   One little word that word was never said
In school days we had been sweethearts
She was her father’s pride
Her folks lived in a mansion
Our cottage by its side
Though years have brought their changes
The same old love still holds
She wed to please her parents
A man of wealth and gold

A long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
I missed those hills with the windy pines
For their song seemed to suit me
I sent my wages to my home
Said we’d soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
I’ll be coming home forever
   One more dime to show for my day
   One more dollar and I’m on my way
   When I reach those hills boys I’ll never roam
   One more dollar and I’m going home
No work said the boss at the bunk house door
There’s a freeze on the branches
When the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances
A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me

I am a going to the banks of the sea
To see the waters gliding herar the nightingales sing

There’s a town not far from here
Lived a maiden sweet and fair
And a lad that loved her better than his life
He was pleading every way
Just to have her name the day
That he might claim her for his little wife
When on the streets they meet
A question he’d repeat
She would laugh and turn her little face away
Till he saw with grief and pain
That his pleadings were in vain
In a jealous rage she softly heard him say
   You are the only girl I ever cared about
   You are the one I love and cannot live without
   Won’t you brighten up my life
   Come and be my little wife
   You are the only girl I ever cared about
She never seen his face no more
Till one day he passed her door
Another girl was walking by his side
They seemed so bright and gay
As they strolled along the way
In a jealous rage she turned away and cried,
He has gone beyond recall
And I love him after all!
When she met the couple on the street next day
He called on her to wait
Introduced his cousin, Kate
Now she’s happy ‘cause she softly heard him say

   For there is no other who’s bound to give me joy
   Tell him that his mother with faded cheeks and hair
   Is at the old home awaiting him there 
Out in the hallway, there stands a vacant chair
An old pair of shoes that he used to wear
Empty is the cradle he used to love so well
Oh, how I miss him no tongue can tell 
Well I remember those parting words he said
We’ll meet up yonder where tears are never shed
In that land of sunshine away from toil and care
When life is over, I’ll meet you up there

Through this life I’ll always own
I was once carefree and happy
When I won my sweetheart’s hand
And now my life is empty
Since she’s wed another man
Do you remember little darlin

And you told me that you loved me
But you proved to be untrue

Many miles from this old place
And I know I’ll never forget you

The sweetest girl of all
There never was yet such eyes of jet
And you can bet I’ll never forget
The night our lips in kisses met
Over the garden wall
There’s always a will there’s always a way
Over the garden wall
There’s always a night as well as a day
Over the garden wall

So while the old feller was snoring asleep
With her lad and her ladder she managed to creep

I left her there back in the mountains
To see the world riches to gain
When I returned no earthly treasure
Could ease this heart so full of pain
There so high upon that mountain
Beneath that little mound of clay

So still among the flowers did lay

Lay aside my earthly gains

So many times that my memories are worn.

   Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
   Well I’m sorry my son but you’re too late in asking
   Mister Peabody’s coal train has hauled it away
Well sometimes we’d travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we’d shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.
Then the coal company came with the world’s largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man.
When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I’ll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waiting
Just five miles away from wherever I am.

   I got a pig at home in a pen corn to feed ‘im on
   All I need is a pretty little girl to feed ‘im when I’m gone.
Goin’ on the mountain to sow a little cane
Raise a barrel of Sorghum sweet lil’ Liza Jane.
Black cloud’s a-risin’ surest sign of rain
Get the old grey bonnet on Little Liza Jane.
Yonder comes that gal of mine how you think I know
Can tell by that Gingham gown hangin’ down so low.
Bake them biscuits baby bake ’em good n’ brown
When you get them biscuits baked we’re Alabamy bound.
When she sees me comin’ she wrings her hands and cries
Yonder comes the sweetest boy that ever lived or died.
Now when she sees me leavin’she wrings her hands and cries
Yonder goes the meanest boy that ever lived or died.

I know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
I only know I’m here without you
And there’s pins and needles in my heart
The days and nights are growing longer
Since first you said that we must part
But now I know I can’t forget you
With pins and needles in my heart
I always see your face before me
Your smile is heaven’s work of art
But now you’re smiling at another
And there’s pins and needles in my heart
Someday somewhere I know I’ll find you
And love will make the teardrops start
And then you’ll know how long I’ve waited
With these pins and needles in my heart

There an empty spot in my life
That no one can fill only you

Of a rose I saw dying today
Remember we walked in the moonlight
We walked we talked alone
Was the night that we were parting
And never again would we roam

Was to me so kind and so true

Cried “Jimmy oh Jimmy you must have no fear;
Just tell them you were hunting when your trial day has come
And you won’t be convicted for what you have done.”

My sisters they were sad
They lay there hands upon my head
And ought me how to pray
   So now my mother she’s gone to rest
   In the land of purist joy
   And I wonder if she thinks of me

When I was only two years old
I never shall forget
A parting kiss she gave to me
I sometimes feel it yet
When I was sick and every hour
She watched me as I lay
And with her kind and gentle hand
She soothed me tenderly
So now I press this world alone
Her love with me shall stay
And from the throne above the skies
Her smiles shall rest on me

Ain’t had me no loving since the day I’ve been gone
Can’t find me no woman in this Yankee land
There’s a place in old Dixie I know where I can
Since I left old Georgia a long time ago
We run Grant’s big army in the land where it snows
The cold wind is blowing and freezing the rain
But there’s hot blood still running through these rebel veins
The call of the wild keeps howling to me
From the mountains down yonder in old Tennessee
Got a woman who’s waiting in old Knoxville town
When night falls I’m going to be Tennessee bound
I’m a poor rebel soldier and I’m going home
Cause I don’t call it living when I’m living alone
Come morning they’ll look but me they won’t find
I’m going to be south of that old Dixie line

While we are living in this world of care
Many the burdens that we have to bear
But there’s a prayer bell at the Lord’s right hand
Give it a ring and He will understand
   Prayer bells of heaven oh how sweetly they ring
   Bearing a message unto Jesus our king
   When you are burdened down with sorrows and care
   Ring on and on for God will answer your prayer
 Three Hebrew children to the fire were thrown
Because a worldly king they would not own
Jesus delivered and the king then saw
Prayer bells of heaven beat a man made law
 When Paul and Silas were thrown into jail
They didn’t worry who would go their bail
But on the prayer bells they began to ring
Off fell the stocks and they begin to sing
 Into the garden Jesus went to pray
Until His sweat became as blood they say
Ringing the prayer bells there in agony
Bringing salvation that we might be free

Way back in the hills when a boy I once wandered
Way deep in the grave lies the gal that I love
She was called from this earth a jewel for heaven
More precious than diamonds more precious than gold
   A jewel here on earth a jewel in heaven
   She’ll brighten the kingdom around God’s great throne
   May the angels have peace God bless her in heaven
   They’ve broken my heart and they’ve left me to roam
When a girl of sixteen we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her in heaven one night
   This world has left its wealth its trials and troubles
   The earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
   But they can’t hold the soul of one precious jewel
   She’s resting in peace in the heavenly fold

Fly across the lonely years

Down at the gate he did address her

Seven years out on the sea
And if he sails seven years longer
No man on earth can marry me

Perhaps he’s in some battle land
Perhaps he stole some girl and married
You’ll never see your love again
If he is drowned I hope he’s happy
Or if he’s in some battle land
Or if he stole some girl and married
I’ll love the girl that married him
He pulled his hand out of his pockets

Kisses he gave her one two three
This is your little single soldier
Returning home to marry thee

She could never place me in her mind for me the years have not been kind

From her station and her place she’d never recognize my face
I have fallen like a wind blown leaf from her memory

Your love for me is like the changing weather
With just enough sun to keep me hanging on
And foolish me keeps hoping it’ll get better
But clouds roll in and once more you are gone.
Rainbows that appear are just illusions
That man has looked for since the days of old
And like the rainbow your love’s always moving
But I keep looking for that pot of gold.

When I first heard the sound of the river going down
knew I had to travel like the waters from my home
To see what I could see go beyond my boundaries
And look into the heart of the life I chose for me.
   On and on oh why must I ramble
   Following dreams out before me in the night
   On and on the highway’s a gamble
   Better think of home again before it’s out of sight.
When I left to see the world my one and only girl
Decided that this passion is a fearful thing to fight
I tried to prove her wrong I said I won’t be long
Please take the love I give you but I knew that she was right.
She never asks the wherefores but sometimes just the whys
That her love alone can hold me from the current deep inside
I hope and pray that she’ll be there each time that I come home
The strength her love still gives me is the thing that lets me roam.

Made up my mind and I’m leavin
Goin away to stay
I’ve decided it’s best and you know all the rest
Honey I’m ramblin away
Once I believed sincerely
That you’d be mine someday
But I do all I do for me and for you
Honey I’m ramblin away

Was just to hear you say
That to me you’d be true but now I’m so blue

Til I  hear an old freight rollin’ down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn’t go I believe I’d blow my stack
I love you baby but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me He made a ramblin’ man
Some folks might say that I’m no good
That I wouldn’t settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin’ me
There’s somethin’ o’er the hill that I gotta see
Sometimes it’s hard but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me He made a ramblin’ man
I love to see the towns a-passin’ by
And to ride these rails ‘neath God’s blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
‘Cause that’s the life I believe He meant for me
And when I’m gone and at my grave you stand
Just say God called home your ramblin’ man

I was raised but a rambling boy
Too many a city I did enjoy
And there I married me a pretty little wife
And I loved her dearer than I love my life
She was pretty both neat and gay
She caused me rob the road highway
I robbed it yes I do declare
I made myself ten thousand there
Plenty dry goods for to carry me through
My pistol swore like money too
My forty four she never failed
My true love come for to go my bale
My mother said she has no home
My sister said she’s all alone

With a broken heart and a baby there

Just place me away in alcohol

Sent down to me from Heaven above

Ere his soul should pass away
And he faintly whispered Parson

To my old Virginia Grand
Will I see the hills of Georgia
And the green fields of Alabam’
Will I see that little church house
Where I placed my heart in hand

See the cars stacked up on him
See him raise his weary head
See his sister standing by him
Crying brother are you dead
Sister sister I am dying
Soon I’ll be on yonder shore
Soon I’ll have a home in heaven
There’ll be no braking anymore
Go and tell my youngest brother
Take these words true and end ?

For his life is sure to end

There’ll be no scales up in heaven

But they don’t care to dance with me
Well it ain’t my fault that the fields are muddy
And the red clay stains my feet
Well its under my nails and its under my collar
And it shows on my Sunday clothes

   But when I pass through the pearly gates
   Will my gown be gold instead
   Or just a red clay robe with red clay wings
   And a red clay halo for my head
It’s mud in the spring and it’s dust in the summer
When it rolls in crimson tide
‘Til the trees and leaves and the cows are the color
Of the dirt on the mountainside
Now Jordan’s banks are red and muddy
And the rolling water is wide
But I got no boat, so I’ll be good and muddy
When I get to the other side

It would be so sweet when all alone I’m dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours ’til the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now and we will never
Be the same except in memory

A sweeter smile and a love more bold and free
But in the end fair weather friends may break your heart dear
If they do sweetheart remember me

No crepes on the doors in that beautiful city
No sorrow or pain never more ever there

There’s where I have roamed for many long years
There’s where my heart’s been tendin most ever
There’s where the first step of misfortune I made
It’s about thirty years when I courted and married
Armanda Gilbraith I’d soon call my wife
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month’s later I’d taken Tom’s life
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next mornin’
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
When the train pulled out poor Mother stood weepin’
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was “Willy God bless you”
Was “Willy God bless you God bless you goodbye”
In the scorching hot sand of the foundry I’m workin’
Toiling and working my poor life away
They’ll measure my grave on the banks of old Cumberland
Just as soon as I finish the rest of my days

We hugged so long I cannot tell

Oh Rose of Alabama
Like alligator after prey
I dives in but it float away

Together as close as can be
But sometimes it’s hard to find time in between
To tell you what you are to me 
   You are the rose of my heart
   You are the love of my life
   A flower not faded nor falling apart
   If you’re tired, rest your head on my arm
    Rose of my Heart. 
 When sorrow holds you in her arms of clay
It’s raindrops that fall from your eyes
Your smile is the dun come to earth for a day
You brighten my blackest of skies 
   You are the rose of my heart
   You are the love of my life
   A flower not faded nor falling apart
   If you’re cool let my love make you warm
    Rose of my heart 
 So hard times are easy times, what do I care
There’s nothing I’d change if I could
The tears and the laughter are things that we share
Your hand in mine makes all times good 
 CH 3 You are the rose…
You are the love…
A flower…
You’re my harbour in life’s restless storm
Rose of my heart.

She bloomed for me in a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows to love each other
And I know we always will.
   She’s my rose of old Kentucky
    I watch her bloom as the years roll by
   For me there’ll never be another
    I’ll love her ’til the day I die.
In my dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
How I long for old Kentucky
For my darling I will meet.
Well I know you often wonder
And I’ll tell you the reason why
She’s my rose of old Kentucky
And I know that she will never lie.

We knew no sorrow and we knew no grief
Until their loving face was missed
There are the engravings upon his tombstone
Each time that we read them we realize he’s gone
Just like a rose he was picked from our view
He was needed in heaven with God’s chosen few
My mother was called just a few weeks before
Two angels have bloomed like a rose on God’s shore
I guess Jesus thought him unsafe here below
So he called him home while he’s ready to go
That beautiful smile on his face that I kissed
I’ve never known sorrow till that face I missed

I met my darling in the springtime
When all the flowers were in bloom
And like the flowers our love blossomed
We married in the month of June
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow (3rd time “cold winds blow”)
We had sunshine in December
And grew our roses in the snow
Now God has taken my darlin’
And left me with a memory
A memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me
My darlin’s buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when the winter snow starts falling
On his grave I’ll place a rose.

I know your friends don’t approve of me
And I can understand why
I’ll never fit into your way of life
There’s no need for me to even try
   I got rough edges all over me
   I can’t change, not even for you
   You can chisel and mold but I’m brittle as coal
   Those edges will never be smooth
I don’t regret that we fell in love
I’m proud I once called you mine
But sweetheart we must say goodbye
We’ve come to the end of the line

The fog is rolling out from Memphis
Dark clouds are hangin’ round your door
It’s a long long way from Mississippi
To the Gulf of Mexico
    Well, I make my home on the Mississippi
    I’m a roustabout on a Steamboat line
    We hit the deck on a Monday morning
    Gonna make the dock on a Saturday night
Had me a gal way up in Vicksburg
I tipped my hat every time she passed
Then she ran off with a riverboat gambler
With a black silk suit and a little mustache
Now when I die there’s just one favor
Don’t bury me down in the cold cold ground
Just wrap me up down by the river
Roll me over and point me south

I am a roving gambler gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down
I had not been in Frisco many more weeks than three
I met up with a pretty little gal
She fell in love with me
Fell in love with me, fell in love with me
She took me in her parlor, cooled me with her fan
Whispered low in her mother’s ear
I love this gambling man
Love this gambling man, love this gambling man
Oh daughter oh dear daughter how can you treat me so
Leave your dear old mother
And with a gambler go
With a gambler go, with a gambler go
My mother oh my mother you can not understand
If you ever see me a coming back
I’ll be with a gambling man
With a gambling man, with a gambling man
I left her there in Frisco and I wound up in Maine
I met up with a gambling man
Got in a poker game
Got in a poker game, got in a poker game
We put our money in the pot and dealt the cards around
I saw him deal from the bottom of the deck
And I shot that gambler down
Shot the gambler down, shot the gambler down
Well, now I’m in the jailhouse got a number for my name
The Warden said as he locked the door
You’ve gambled your last game
Gambled your last game, gambled your last game

Dust in the meadow, smoke on the mountainside
Theres an air of desparation comin cross the great divide
Thunder rollin, shakin the valley down
But it ain’t the second comin thats drummin up that soud
     
    Its the train of broken dreams run on misery and woe
    Come to take the down-trodden when there’s noplace else to go
    And there’ll be no mistakin when you hear that whistle whine
    You’re standin at the station of the ruination line
Tell you brother I can’t get no sleep
There’s heretics in the capitol and heroes on the street
In this corp’rate prison what for is my bail
Its 80 bucks a barrell son your freedom is for sale
   
    Well they give me excuses, they give me their word
    But its hard to give a damn when your unemployed, uninsured
    Can’t afford to pay no doctor, no ambulance ride
    They just left me with my chances on the ruination line
Drive your mule boy, up that field and back
You gotta earn your keep here make no doubt about that fact
No time for stallin, no time for to wait
No time for your lost soul just tryin to find its place
     
    All I ever wanted was a little peace and quiet
    A stash of my own,and a girl to hold tight
    But now I’m broke,dry and dirty and my good love passed me by
    Feel I’m primed and ready for that ruination line
So lay my head down on that rail
And maybe she can ease my mind
And I pray she moves me swiftly down that ruination line

I’m a prisoner alone and forgotten
I’ll be here until the day I die
All because when a boy I was foolish
All because I was fast with a knife
I’m a man that’s doomed to be lonely
I’m a man that’s doomed to be sad
I’ve got no name just a number
And I’ve lost all the friends that I’ve had
If I had my life to live over
I’d travel the narrow and straight
But I’d still be at home with my loved ones
And not behind these iron gates
Young men when you have heard my story
Let it teach you the right from the wrong
And I know my life wasn’t wasted

When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave as bad as you want them to stay
    And theres nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
    When one don’t care at all and the other cares too much
    Its a sad situation I must say
    When someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you but I know you dont love me
And I know its just a matter of time before you leave
But why do I stand aside and just let you walk away
When I know you want to leave as bad as I want you to stay
    What do you do, what do you say
    When you know they want to leave as bad as you want them to stay

A Sailor’s life is a merry life
He robs young girls of their heart’s delight
Leaving them alone to weep and mourn
They never know when he’ll return
Of four and twenty all in a row
My true love makes the finest show
He’s proper tall, genteel with all
If I can’t have him I’ll have none at all
My father built me a bonny boat
That on the ocean I might float
And every queen ship that we passed by
I’d there inquire for my sailor boy
She had not sailed long upon the deep
When a queen ship she chanced to meet
You sailors all please tell me true
Does my sweet William sail among your crew?
Oh no fair maiden he’s not here
For he’s been drowned we greatly fear
On yon green island as we passed by
There we lost sight upon your sailor boy
She wrung her hands, she tore her hair
She was a maid in great despair
Her little boat on the rock she did run
Saying how shall I live now that my William is gone?
A sailor’s life is a merry life
He robs young girls of their heart’s delight
Leaving them behind to weep and mourn
They never know when he’ll return

Who is sailing on the deep blue sea
“Oh, captain, can you tell me,
Can you tell me where he may be?”

For I’m going to end my troubles
By drowning in the deep blue sea

But if you do I’ll tell you true my boat will never land 
You promised that you would wait for me that nothin’ could come between
That in my arms someday you’d be my wife and lovely Queen
I built you that cozy home and made a garden there
And planted too with my own hands sweet flowers rich and fair
My future hopes are placed in you you’ve been my guidin’ star
Please write and tell me that you’re true to the sailor who waits afar
Just tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
I’ll return and then we’ll wed and live a happy life

In a pine treated grave by the river
Where the nightingale sings sad and low
All alone lies a Saint Regis maiden
Who did sing this sad song years ago
Never more will my heart fill with gladness
As I stroll through the forest again
For to prison they’ve taken my lover
That’s why my poor heart’s full of pain
When in prison your dying from sorrow
I hope you’ll recall those last days
That together we spent in this valley
And the vows that we’ve shared on its quay
Oh if I could but burn down that prison
To steal you away for awhile
They could carry me off to the gallows
And I’d go to my doom with a smile
When the moon is high in the heavens
And the mountains do gleam in its light
How often I’ll dream of you sweetheart
As I mourn there alone in the night
There will be a green grave in the forest
And people when passing that way
Will think of that Saint Regis maiden
As she lies there alone in the clay
A shadow has crossed o’er the valley
Where once only sunshine did reign
But where ever life’s pathway may lead me
I shall ever remember our dream
In the future someday I will meet you
On the bright shore so far from this world
And there before God I will greet you
That’s the dream of the Saint Regis girl

Standing by the railroad waiting for a train
I’m gonna catch that midnight train and never come back again
It’s a lonesome feeling, Sand Mountain blues
I went to the gypsy just to hear what she would say
She said, that girl don’t love you and you’d better be on your way
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
I don’t know where to go, any old place will do
I’m leaving old Sand Mountain, just getting away from you
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
There’s other girls around here and I could love ’em too
But every time I saw you, it’d make me sad and blue
It’s a lonesome feeling, Sand Mountain blues
When it makes you lonesome to hear that freight train blow
Then you will know I’m riding, but I didn’t want to go
It’s a lonesome feeling, Sand Mountain blues
When it’s raining on Sand Mountain, and raining kind of slow
Then maybe you’ll remember and ?? you make me go
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
I am just a poor boy, and work’s my middle name
I guess that’s why you said goodbye, but I love you just the same
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
If you ever need me, then maybe I’ll come back

I travelled near and far
It doesn’t seem so long ago
I saw the world from a railroad car
For many years rode the line
Through the woods the freight train would roll
‘Cross fields of grain muddy river plain
My heart would often go
The engineer’s hair is gray
Worn out engine can’t even go slow
I listen for the lonesome sound
Can’t you hear that whistle blow?
I spy ten boxcars silent and still
They remind me of yesterday
Their rusted frames worn and bent
Faded letters read “Santa Fe”
The great steam engines quiet and cold
Metal chimes in the howling wind
The boiler’s busted whistle cracked
Never hear her blow again

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I’d do things my way
But little they know that it’s so hard to find

Once I was winning in fortune and fame
I had all that I needed to get a start in life’s game
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
I’m better off now, with a satisfied mind
Cause money can’t buy back your youth when you’re old
Or a friend when you’re lonesome, or a love that’s grown cold
And the wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When this life is ended, my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I’ll leave, there’s no doubt
But one thing for certain, when I’ve served my time
I’ll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

   And in every lover’s eyes I’ll see your face. 
I’ve heard for everything there is a season
And I’ve come to see that winter heralds spring
So if we have to part I’ll try not to regret it
For the love we shared will brighten every thing 
When my last breath on earth is taken
And all my rivers flow down to the sea
I only hope for me it can be written
That I tried to be the best that I could be

   Down by the waterfall
   Where the waters run so cool
   There no secrets ever fall
   From the lips of the fool
Jeniffer was seventeen the same age as I
She had lived next door to us since we were five
She knew I loved her dearly, I told her many times
And I looked forward to the day that she would be all mine
One more year of school we thought, then wedding bells would ring
But the hand of fate has ways of changing everything
I walked upon the two of them down by the waterfall
Jeniffer and Jimmy Jones they saw me not at all
Jimmy Jones was married and had a family
And I just couldn’t understand why they did this to me
Both were scared but all they thought I’d do was tell his wife
Their faces turned to masks of fear before I took their life
People thought that Jeniffer just up and ran away
Jimmy Jones who disappeared is a mystery today
Many years has passed but bitterly I still recall
And only I alone know what’s behind the waterfall

   See God’s ark a-movin’ see God’s ark a-movin’
   Picks me up on my lonely days and carries me through tomorrow
The rain came up hard you know
And the wind began to blow
And I lifted my voice up into the sky
Crying mercy to my soul.
God must have felt my faith
He held me until it was safe
And I never again drew a doubting breath
As he delivered me from my death.
If you can’t resist temptation
If you just can’t put it down
When the ark sets sail on the rolling sea
You’re gonna follow the boat and drown.

All night I’ve wrestled Jacob’s angels and prayed with Matthew Luke and John
Struggling to find the words to face the task that comes upon the blood red dawn
I’ve buried men before their time of alcohol and blackened lung
but how to bury seven of these Appalachian miners sons
who stormed the beaches wave on wave and sailed home to these rocky graves
and family plots that bear their names
Tomorrow Ill walk up, seven hillsides
tremble before my flock on seven hillsides
seven sorrows seven sons, seven mothers and every one
will turn to me for the word of God what does this mean
and there I’ll stand good book in hand a shepherd to these precious lambs
what will I say what will I say what can I say
To tell the truth Id never thought much about the will of God before
called to preach at seventeen I was in love with fiery words and not much more
The time has come to keep the faith for others shattered by their loss
remind them of a loving God whose son like theirs paid the cost to save a
sad and wicked world through sacrifice our love is heard and pray that I believe
those words

Just seven years ago today
Was when you said good-bye
It broke my heart to see you go
And yet I could not cry
You kissed me sweet and said good-bye
But I could not believe
That you would ever make me cry
Unwanted and to grieve
The sun is slowly sinking down
To make the close of day
To make the end of seven years
The ending of my way
I had no one to stand by me
To count these bitter tears
I could never live these awful blues
Another seven years
I had waited seven years today
To see your face once more
And if my life could be as long
I’d wait ten thousand more

I met a fair maiden she sure did look grand
Her lace and her diamonds and her hair shone like gold
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old
Her fingers they jingled like bells on a door
Her nose was turned up but not very much more
When we were married the wedding bells told
I have married a young lady just nineteen years old
When we were married and retired for our rest
My love changed for her why you can guess
For a box full of powders my love did unfold
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old
She raked from her pale cheeks a box full of paint
When she took out her false teeth I thought I would faint
Out upon the carpet her glass eye did roll
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old
She unsnapped her fingers I counted just three
Then she unscrewed both cork legs up to her knees
When she took off her false wig her old bald head told
I had married an old lady about ninety years old

There I met with a girl I had loved as a boy
Gone are the days when our hearts beat as one
All I can say now is see what you done
Gone are the days when we thrilled to each vow
She has forgotten everything now
I still have her picture her face sweet and fair
A rose that she gave me a lock of her hair
I’ll treasure and keep them it’s silly I know
For she has forgotten long long ago

From the Florida sunshine to the New Orleans rain

Once a pullman car traveller, now the switchmen won’t have her

He bought her a fur coat and big diamond ring
But she hocked ’em for hard cash, left town on the Wabash
Never thinkin’, never thinkin’ of home way back then 
 Now the rails are all rusty, and the dining car dusty
The gold plated watches have taken their toll

On a bus to Kentuckyand home, that’s her goal

I swore her in high school and there I won her love
And then I joined the service I lived to serve my time
And then a guy met her with eyes that seemed like mine

I can see how wrong I’ve been for all these years
For she offered me a lifetime of devotion

On one cold and rainy night I was sitting in the light
Of my switchman’s shack on my post on the mountain
The storm was pretty bad and the telegraph was dead
And it was just eleven hours ’til the dawning.
Then much to my surprise the telegraph jumped back to life
As I read the code I thought could this be true
A train was on it’s way headed up the mountain grade
But she didn’t have a captain or a crew.
At the other switch they tried to put her on the mountainside
But she kept on coming up the mountain grade
I quickly doused the light to try to see into the night
Maybe I could spot her headlight in the rain.
She was pounding down the road I could hear her whistle blow
And I thought lord what a high and mournful sound
Then the telegraph beganThere’s a cave-in at the mine
And a hundred men are buried beneath the ground
.
But Lord she’s coming now I see around the bend and straight at me
And her boiler’s glowing red as coal in hell
The headlight’s switching wide searching all the mountainside
But the only sound she’s making is the wail
Then I recognize the train by the number and the name
It’s the Miner’s Silver Ghost Old 41
Then she vanished up the track by the lonely switchman’s shack
Like a mother who is looking for her son
Now I recall the story of the train that went to glory
Over fifty years ago on this same night
She was stealing for the cave-in there were men that needed saving
But she missed the curve and trestle near the mine.
Now every now and then you’ll hear her whistle on the wind
If the mountain slides and many men are lost
It’s the high and lonely wailing searching up and down the mountain
The train they call the call the Miner’s Silver Ghost

With a tear in every rooom

Beneath the halo’d moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating game 
   Silver thread and golden needles
   Cannot mend this heart of mine
   And I dare not drown my sorrows
   In the warm glow of your wine
   You can’t buy my love with money
   For I never was that kind
   Silver thread and golden needles
   Cannot mend this heart of mine. 
I grew up in faded gingham
Where love is a sacred thing
You grew up in silk and satin
Where love’s a passing game
I know now you never loved me
And I know I was a fool
To think your pride would let you
Live by the Golden Rule.

Singing rejoicing as they kneel in prayer
Then an old fashioned handshake and gather around
At the Singing all day and dinner on the ground
We would sing those old songs and the preacher would preach
Of how Jesus died for you and for me
You could feel the Great Spirit from Heaven pouring down
At the singing all day and dinner on the ground

There was a little ship
And it sailed upon the sea
And she went by the name of the Merry Golden Tree
And she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
And she sailed upon the lonesome sea
There was a little sailor
Unto his captain said
Oh captain captain what’ll you give to me
If I sink them in the low and lonesome low
If I sink them in the lonesome sea
Two hundred dollars
I will give unto thee
And my oldest daughter I will wed unto you
If you sink them in the low and lonesome low
If you sink them in the lonesome sea
He bowed upon his breast
And away swim he
Till he came the ship of the Turkish Reveille
As she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As she sailed upon the lonesome sea
If it wasn’t for the love
Of your daughter and your men
I would do unto you as I did unto them
I would sink you in the low and lonesome low
I would sink you in the lonesome sea
He bowed his head
And down sank he
Farewell farewell to the Merry Golden Tree
For I’m sinking in the low and lonesome low
For I’m sinking in the lonesome sea

And I know who’s the one who provides it all

Some of you I know will let it pass
There’s sadness in my heart knowing we will have to part

I’ll sing you a song of the world and its ways
And the many strange people you meet
From the rich man who’s rolled in his millions of gold
To the poor struggling wretch on the street
But a man tho’ he’s poor and in tatters and rags
We should never affect to despise
But think of the adage remember my friends
That six feet of earth makes us all of one size
There’s the rich man with thousands to spare if he likes
But he haughtily holds up his head
And who thinks he’s above the mechanic who toils
And is honestly earning his bread
But his gold and his jewels he can’t take away
To the world up above when he dies
For death levels all and conclusively shows
That six feet of earth makes us all of one size 
There’s many a coat that is tatter’d and torn,
That beneath lies a true honest heart
But because he’s not dressed like his neighbors in style,
Why “society” keeps them apart;
For on one fortune smiles, while the other one fails,
Yes no matter what venture he tries,
But time calls them both to the grave in the end
And six feet of earth makes us all of one size 
Then when you once see a poor fellow that tries,
To baffle the world and its frown,
Let us help him along and perhaps he’ll succeed
Don’t crush him because he is down,
For a cup of cold water for charity’s sake,
Is remembered with joy in the skies,
We’re all of us human, we’ve all got to die,
And six feet of earth makes us all of one size

And little flakes of snow have faded my sweetheart’s path tonight

   I don’t know why she left me I never dreamed she’d go away
   Little snow flakes fell from Heaven from the Heaven way up above
   And paved a way made a snow white grave of the only one I loved
She left a memory of tender love and a picture on the wall

And each moment I grow weaker sadly gazing at the snow
And I feel that I will fade away with that slow melting snow

I’ll have finished my time here allotted
But I won’t be in darkness alone
I will have heard from Heaven
The summons to come on home
And when my body is in the grave
Don’t think that I’ll be there
I won’t be dead, but living
In the place Jesus went to prepare
And after all is said and done
Know that my last earnest prayer
Is that my loved ones be ready
Someday to meet me thereBl

And the devil said don’t you go in
I said I’ll go in for that cannot hurt
And sit as far back as I can
About that time he got up to leave
And he looked right down upon me
He told everybody how mean I had been
Not thinking so much of me
They sing and shout and they all clapped their hands
And they all got down on their knees
When the fire came from heaven it fell right on me
And then I fell to the floor

Waiting for the fast mail train the semaphore to clear.

Looking at the water glass and letting down the sand
Rolling out on the old main line and taking up the slack
Gone today so they say but tomorrow he’ll be coming back.

Creeping down the rusty rails of the weed grown branch line

Rolling down to Birmingham with a ten car load of freight.

Suits my poor heart

I have a stove that’s worth ten cents
A table worth fifteen
I cook my gruel in oyster cans
And keep my things so clean
   Oh little sod shanty
   Little sod shanty give to me
   For I’m a stern old bachelor
   From matrimony free
When I come home at night
I smile and walk right in
I never hear a voice yell out
Or say where have you been
On a cold and stormy night
In a cozy little shack
I sing my songs and think my thoughts
With no one to talk back
I go to bed when ever I please
And get up just the same
I change my socks three times a year
With no one to complain
At night when I’m on peaceful sleep
My snores can do no harm
I never have to walk the floor
With a baby in my arms
And when I die and go to heaven
As all good bachelors do
I will not have to grieve for fear
My wife will get there too

Now I’m so broken hearted I don’t know what to do
I passed you today on the street
And you treated me like a stranger that you never knew
It’s the same every time we meet
You built a stone wall all around your heart
Though my arms ache to hold you as before
You built a stone wall all around your heart
You won’t let me love you anymore
How have I hurt you darling why won’t you say
What have I done to you
For I still worship you dear in the same old way
How could you forget the love we knew

All for the love of another man’s wife
But I’ve had it coming I’ve known all the time

But I’ve had it coming at the end of the line
No more stone walls and steel bars and you on my mind

There’s stormy horizons in my heart
Rain sweept and tattered like the rose in the wind
Stormy horizons without and within
You were all that mattered but you wanted to be free
Now stormy horizons wait for me
Of things as fragile and as sweet as roses dreams are made
And dreams we had you held so carelessly
They fell like petals round my feet I saw my rainbow fade
Now stormy horizons wait for me

   Stormy waters surround me but I’ll hold to God’s unchanging hand
Angry billows may toss me and cause me to fear
Stormy waters around me may roll
I will hold to the hand of my Saviour so dear

Though I have disappointments so often I sigh
And my cabin is humble and bare
But someday I’ll inhearit a mansion on high
Where the beauties of heaven I’ll share

   And our hearts are filled with pain
   There is sunshine when we’re burdened

Oh why do the years go so slow 
But I know he’s away in a far distant land
A land that is over the sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And tell him to come back to me 
Upon my finger he placed a small ring
On the day he was leaving his home
I promised I’d be his own little girl
And love him wherever he’d roam

To that sweet sunny south take me home
Where the mockingbird sings me to sleep every night
Oh why was I tempted to roam
I think with regret of the dear home I left
Of the warm hearts that sheltered me there
Of wife and of children of whom I’m bereft
Of the old place again do I sigh
Take me back to the place where the orange trees grow
To my plot in the evergreen shade
Where the flowers from the river’s green margins did grow
And spread their sweet scent through the glade
Take me back let me see what is left that I know
Could it be that the old house is gone
Dear friends from my childhood indeed must be few
And I must face death all alone
The path to our cottage they say has grown green
And the place is quite lonely around
I know that the smiles and the forms I once knew
Now lie ‘neath the cold mossy ground
But yet I return to the place of my birth
Where the children have played ‘round the door
Where they gathered wild blossoms that grew ‘round the path
Twill echo their footsteps no more
Take me back to the place where my little ones sleep
Where poor massa lies buried close by
O’er the graves of my loved ones I long for to weep
and rest there among them when I die

But now that we’ve thought it all over Mama
We know you’re spirit is here

   To speak of you now would only hurt Father
   Oh no momma we’ll never forget you
   And someday we’ll meet you up there
We all gathered round and I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But this was one time we all had to face it
Though it hurt us so badly you know
Well it looked so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh no Mother when I passed by your casket

To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done
   She did not bring to him parole or pardon free
   She brought no silver, gold no pomp or style to see
   It was a halo bright brought down from heaven’s light
   The sweetest gift, a mother’s smile
Her boy had drifted far from the fireside
though she had pleaded with him each night
Yet not a word did she ever utter
That told her heartaches her smile was bright
She left a smile you can remember
She’s gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those bars around you could never change her
You were her baby and e’er will be

   Does your mind wander back to the past

I remember that night in the moonlight
When you said that you’d found someone new
Do you realize the heartache you’ve caused me

Wandering back to the place of my childhood
And the one that I’ve always loved the best

The hum of the bees in the hay
The farther I walk, the harder they talk
How silent it seems here today 
There’s an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch
Surrounding the old family graves
And there’s one gravestone standing all alone
There waiting to join me in the shade

You wrecked our life and broke our vows
You’ll have to pay for it somehow

Tonight I’m so lonesome heartbroken and blue
I’d give all this world one more to see you
Each night my pillow from tears is all wet
I’m cryin’ my heart out these tears of regret
   Tears of Regret I’m shedding for you
   To wallow in my heart no good would it do
   Tears that are fallin’ won’t make you return
   Tears of regret while alone I must yearn
If you’re ever lonely and think about me
Remember my darlin’ no pleasure I’ll see
I look to the future through tears of regret
I’ve lost you forever but I’ll not forget
Come back to me darlin’ I’m waitin’ for you
I promise forever this time to be true
I lost a treasure more precious than gold
Now tears of regret is my payment I know

I’m alone tonight my darling
With another you have gone
Yet you tell me that you love me
That you’ll always be my own
Yet no promise do you give me
When I beg you to be true
You just leave me sadly weepin’
Broken hearted over you
Tell me now or tell me never
You must answer me somehow
For I’ve grown so tired of waiting
Waiting for your solemn vow
I have always loved you darling
And I tried to make you care
But you’ve run around with others
Leaving my life cold and bare
With no promise for the future
You have left me here to cry
You must tell me little darling
Let your conscience be your guide

We parted by the riverside
The moon looked down on you and me
The stars put on a look of pride
The river murmured to the sea
The dew drop kissed a blushing rose
The mournful wind did sigh
One word broke nature’s sweet repose
That sad word was goodbye
   
   Oh tell me that you love me yet
   For oh this parting gives me pain
   Please tell me that you’ll not forget
   For we may never meet again
We parted by the riverside
Though I have roamed in distant climes
My heart has not forgot it’s pride
For I have loved you all the time
And I am faithful to you still
As long as you are true
Let day each bring to me what it will
For I love you only you

A little tot was playing one night upon the floor
Her mother sat and id’ly watched the little girl of four
All at once she dropped her toys and tears begining to shed
She climbed upon her mother’s knee and this is what she said
   Tell my why my daddy don’t come home
   I know that I am much to big to cry
   Why don’t he come and play with me again
   Mommy why did daddy say goodbye
That night she wrote a letter to one whose name she bore
She asked him to forget the past and come back once more

Won’t you please come back again so she won’t have to say

For you to change your ways
But starting today it’s all over
The price is more than I can pay

I’ve knelt at your command
But now it’s too late things are different
The price is more than I can stand
Ten lonesome years filled with heart aches
For me is what you planned
But I’ve had enough so I’m leaving
The price is more than I can stand
The past will soon be forgotten
I’ll find a new love so grand
Now it’s too late it’s all over

Sometimes when I’m feeling lonesome and none on earth seems to care
I’m all by myself in the darkness with no one and nothing to share
Just when it feels like it’s over and I’ll never make it alone
I hear the voices of angels tenderly calling me home
   Home come on home
   Ye who are weary come home
   Softly and tender they call me
   Home come on home
I try to keep it together and I never let on that I’m scared
till sometimes I fall to pieces scattered and lost everywhere
and just when it feels like it’s hopeless and I’ll never make it alone
I hear the voice deep inside me it’s tenderly calling me home
Don’t be afraid of the darkness don’t run away from the storm
stand up and face your reflection and feeling’s you try to ignore
cause after the tempest is over and you let yourself go on thru
you’ll hear a voice in the silence it’s tenderly calling to you

When I was a little boy around the folks back home
My mother always said to me Jimmy, please don’t roam
Now that I have gone away my heart is full of woe
When I think of Mom and Dad that’s where I want to go
If ever I get back to that state of Tennessee
I tell you there’ll be no more roaming for me
There lives a sweetheart who said she’d marry me
As soon as I get back to that state of Tennessee

I wonder if It’s rainin’ in the mountains
I wonder how the old town looks today
And if the church is there beside the river
Could I go back and find where mama lay
Does life still go to sleep just after sunset
Are the berries still as big on the vine
Do old men sit and talk about the old days
The way they did in 1949
   Oh Oh Oh how I’d like to be
   Back in the hills of Tennessee
   Oh Oh Oh it would be so fine
   If I could just go back to 1949
I wonder if by chance they might remember
A teenage boy so wild and fancy free
Who always loved guitars and country music
If I went back would they remember me
I wonder what became of Kathern Ackers
The girl who broke my heart at seventeen
I barely can remember what she looks like
Thirty years ago she was my dream

And now I’m searching pictures in my memory

And not have to worry

   A place I could lose the Tennessee Blues 
 I’d find me a spot on some mountain top
With no one around me

And hills that surround me.

I’d keep just the good times
I’d wake and I’d sleep, nothing but peace
Feel free all the time.

Sittin’ on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straight-back chair on two legs leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a-playin’ with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin’ fireflies when evening shadows fall
   In my Tennessee mountain home
   Life is as peaceful as a baby’s sigh
   In my Tennessee mountain home
   Crickets singing in the fields near by
Honeysuckle vines cling to the fences along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads its wings
And a songbird on a fence post sings a melody
Drivin’ home from charch on Sunday with the one you love
Just laughin ‘talkin’ makin’ future plans
And when the folks ain’t lookin’ you might steal a kiss or two
Just sittin’ in the porch swing holdin’ hands

   They make all the meadows as blue as the skies
   Reminding me of my little darlings blue eyes
Well I wanted to ramble so I started to roam
And I didn’t think twice about leaving my home
But when I got to Texas not far from Burnet
Those Texas bluebonnets wouldn’t let me forget
I ran out of money went to work on a farm
Picking their melons and hoeing their corn
And all winter long Lord I herded their cows
And I tried to forget my little darling somehow
But then springtime had blossomed
And it just made my head feel bluer than blue
Those Texas bluebonnets they smiled in the sun
But they just made me think of my only one
I’m leaving the southland I’m leaving today
I don’t know where I’m going but I know that I can’t stay
I guess I’ll go north to the ice and the snow
Where those Texas bluebonnets never will grow
In the cold frozen Iceland I’ll live ’til I die
Where I’ll finally forget my little darlings blue eyes

All my life I’ve wondered if what I’ve done was wrong
All I ever cared to do is ride my pony on
I never had no heartaches, was always happy and gay
Until I met a Texas girl who stole my heart away. 
   Where the sleepy Rio Grande goes slowly to the sea
   It was there she promised to be mine throughout eternity
   But the angels they grew jelous of her beauty and her smile
   And came along one stormy night and stole away my bride
   The birds have hushed their singing, sadness is over the land
   Little birds miss my darlin’ by the sleepy Rio Grande. 
Her lips were like the russian wine, her hair it hung in curls
Her cheeks were like the dawn of day that breaks upon the world
She’s gone and left me lonely, I miss the touch of her hand
Tonight while I am walking by the sleepy Rio Grande.

Underneath a beech nut tree there in the mountains
Where we met and told each other of our love
There we promised to each other we would marry

This is one song that had a happy ending
For we’re married now and in her eyes I see

Anything you want, I’ll surely do

And I won’t do right if I can do you wrong

I knew she was my kind of woman
No one could ever take her place
I said when working hours are over
I would just love to take you home
She said young man that is a pleasure
And soon we found ourselves alone
And then our arms went around each other
I felt a knife stick in her back
She turned and saw her lover running
And said his name was Barnum Jack
She did not know her lover followed
She did not know he was around
Until the fate of death had struck her
And now she sleeps beneath the ground
I sit alone tonight in prison
My thoughts are of the one so fair
That I met that night in the Wayside Tavern
When the smell of drink was in the air

He offers just brimstone and fire
A lowdown thief a cheater and a liar
But the Lord will give you love and treat you well

    To change my ways I cannot see
    Before I die it can’t be far away
    I believe in the God that never fails
    Delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale
    Give me that old time religion that’s for me
I have a promise from God above
The one who gave me this book of love
Says he’ll never leave me or forsake me
And when the devil’s at my back door
I’ll raise my hand and kneel on the floor
I pray that the Lord will lead me through

All of the good thing the trouble and strife
Well my share of heartaches yes so many I’ve had
But I still think the good things out weigh the bad
Well I’ve rocked my babies at night when they’d cry
I’ve seen the teardrops turn into smiles
And that’s when I realize all the bad luck I’ve had
And I know all the good things out weigh the bad
Well I’ve never had riches or money to spare
Just a share croppers wages is my only fare
Yes making my living just working the land
But I still think the good things out weigh the bad
Yes I worked the cotton in the heat of the day
And then paid the landlord nearly all that I’d made
Well I’ve seen high taxes take all that I had
But I still think the good things out weigh the bad

   Though the times are sad and drear and I cannot linger here
   They’ll keep me and never let me go.
My daddy said don’t ever be a miner
or a miner’s grave is all you’ll ever own
There’s hard times everywhereI can’t find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I’ve ever known
So I’ll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you’ll find me there
Though I’ll leave the past behind ‘ll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I can bear.
Someday I’ll go back to West Virginia
To those green rolling hills I love so well
Oh omeday I’ll go home and I know I’ll right the wrong
And these hard times will follow me no more.

I remember as a boy how in wonderment and joy
I’d watch the trains as they’d go by
And the whistle’s lonesome sound you could here from miles around
As they rolled across that Greenville Trestle high.
   But the whistles don’t sound like they used to
   Lately not many trains go by
   Hard times across the land mean no work for a railroad man
   And the Greenville Trestle now don’t seem so high.
On the riverbank I’d stand with a cane pole in my hand
And watch the freight trains up against the sky
With the black smoke trailing back as they moved along the track
That runs across that Greenville Trestle high.
When the lonesome whistles whined I’d get rambling on my mind
Lord I wish they still sounded that way
As I turned to head for home Lord she’d rumble low and long
Toward the sunset at the close of day.

Where the pines sing in the wind
Where my daddy lived before me
And my grandpa before him
We believe in simple livin’
It’s the only life we know
All we need here is our freedom
And a place to call our own
   In the land of Ethan Allen
   Where the sugar maples grow
   Where the wild grass fills the meadows
   And the rocky rivers flow
   By the hills that I call home
Now I have traveled cross the country
And there is much that I have learned
Still I felt no peace inside me
Till the day that I returned
For there’re two things you can count on
In this troubled world we face
Every season has an ending
Every person has a place

He saw my sin and knew they would keep me
Out of his heaven but he believed I was worth saving
So he came down to earth as a man
Took the sin that condemned me
Paid the price for me so that I could come in
The key to heaven was hung on a nail
On the cross where he suffered
His love prevailed He opened the flood gates
Parted the veil
The key to heaven was hung on a nail
Bethlehem’s manger was a quiet beginning
You knew he was coming but he died on a hill
With so many watching and even history
Says that he lived but it doesn’t explain
Why he endured the shame and died like he did

When I was a curly headed baby
My daddy set me down on his knee
Saying boy you go to school and you learn your letters
Don’t become no dusty miner boy like me.
   And I was born and raised in the mouth of a Hazzard holler
   Where the coal cars rolled and rumbled past my door
   But now they stand in a rusty row of empties
   ‘Cause the L&N don’t stop here anymore.
Now I used to think my daddy was a black man
With script enough to buy the company store
Oh but now he goes to town with empty pockets
And Lord his face is as white as a February snow.
Never thought I’d ever live to love that coal dust
Never thought I’d pray to hear those tipples roar
Oh but God I wish the grass would turn to money
And feel my greenbacks in my pockets once more.
Lastnight I dreamed I went down to the office
To get my payday like I’ve done before
But those kudzu vines they were covering over the doorway
And there were weeds and grass growing right up through the floor.

What have I done that has made you so bitter and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you’ll be contented again
Will you be happy when we are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you’ll only say that you’ll forever be mine
Think of the heartaches the pain and suffering you’ll save
While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you have broken so free
But to this old world I’ll soon bid my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me

Made of sand, made of sand
In the wnk of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand, in your hand. 
   Are you going away with no word of farewell
   Will there be not a trace left behind?
   I could have loved you better, didn’t mean to be unkind
   You know that was the last thing on my mind. 
 As we walk along my thoughts are tumbling
Round and round, round and round.
Underneath our feet a subway’s rumbling
Underground, underground. 
 You’ve got reasons aplenty for going
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing
Please don’t go, please don’t go 
 As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Every song in my head dies a-borning
Without you, without you

By his side there stood a preacher Ere his soul should pass away.
And he faintly whispered: “Parson” as he clutched him by the hand
Oh Parson, tell me quickly, Will my sould pass through the southland?
Will my soul pass through the Southland, through old Virginia grand
Will i see the hills of Georgia and the green fields of Alabam?
Will i see that little churchhouse, where i pledged my heart and hand
Oh Parson, tell me quickly, will my soul pass thorugh the Southland?
Was for loving dear old Dixie, in this dreary cell I lie
Was for loving dear old Dixie, in this northern state i die.
Will you see my littl daughter, wil you make her understand
Oh Parson, tell my quickly, will my soul pass through the Southland?

Of the postman at the closing of the day
But he turned away and cried while the tears stood in his eyes

Of’t from early morning light he would wait till dark of night

To the little old church by the road
I can see the dear people and hear them so plain
Singing songs of that blessed abode
I can hear my dear mother as she fervently prayed
Blessed Jesus help me carry my load
she was never downhearted and never dismayed
In the little old church by the road
There my mother was praying and the preacher was saying
Sinner come and repent your sins
There the [evil was routed?] and  the sisters were singing
And brethren saying amen
It was there I met Jesus and gave Him my life
It was there He took the weight off my load
And He freely removed all my sorrow and strife
In the little old church by the road
I remember the preacHer so gentle and brave
As He told how the Father above
Gave His only son Jesus all the lost ones to save
Such wonderful wonderful love
I will always remember how He spoke when He said
Come to Jesus He will lighten your load
And so often He told of the life giving bread
In the little old church by the road
I can never forget all those lovely old songs
That the people so joyfully sang
How they told the Lord message to the people gone wrong
And the echos so joyfully rang
I will always remember when I truly believed
Jesus freely took the weight off my load
And the joy of salvation I truly recieved
In the little old church by the road

Way down in a lone green valley
Down where the roses bloom and fade
There was a jealous lover
In love with a beautiful maid
One night the moon shone brightly
The stars were shining too
And to this maiden’s cottage
The jealous lover drew
Come love and we will wander
Where the woods are gay
While strolling we will ponder
Upon our wedding day
So on and on they wandered
The night bird sang above
The jealous lover grew angry
With the beautiful girl he loved
Down on her knees before him
She pleaded for her life
But deep into her bossom
He plunged the fatal knife
Oh Willie won’t you tell me
Why have you taken my life
You know I’ve always loved you
And wanted to be your wife
I never have deceived you
But with my dying breath
I will forgive you Willie
And close my eyes in death

Underneath that Summer sky
I heard a voice so soft and tender
A neighbor girl sat by my side
   I’ve loved you darlin’ for so long now
   I’ve watched and waited all these years
   They say tomorrow you’ll be married
   How can I face these lonely years
So long ago I still remember
The words she said I can’t forget
I told her that I loved another
She bowed her head and slowly left
   They buried her down in the churchyard
   At last her lonely heart is free
   The one I loved soon met another

Underneath that Summer sky
I heard no voice so soft and tender
There was no one by my side

And the sinners hear their eternal doom
At the sad decree they’ll depart for aye
Into endless woe and gloom yes woe and gloom

    The unredeemed must ever pay
    Though for help I cry it’s now in vain
    For alas I’m doomed for aye
If I could recall all the years now gone
For my Savior’s cause I would spend each one
But they never again can to me return
And the task is left is left undone (it’s left undone)

What a dark mistake all my life has been

And I must pay the price of sin

You have heard of fearless David and his sling

And of Jonah and the whale you often sing
There are many, many others through the Bible
I should like to meet them all I do declare
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them
At that meeting in the air
There is going to be a meeting in the air
In the sweet sweet bye and bye
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky
Such singing you will hear—never heard by mortal ear
‘Twill be glorious I do declare
And God’s own son will be the leading one
At the meeting in the air
Many things there will be missing in that meeting
For the mourner’s bench will have no place at all
There will never be a sermon preached to sinners
For the sinners had refused to heed the call
There will be no mourning over wayward loved ones
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air
There the doubters will be missing altogether
All the skeptics will be absent on that day
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us
And the Achans will be busy far away
There the saints will have His seal upon their foreheads
Dressed in raiment none but ransomed ones can wear
All who have the wedding garment will be present
At that meeting in the air

She’ll brighten the kingdom around God’s Great Throne
May the angels have peace God bless her in heaven

When a girl of sixteen we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger

And some of us may die
But praise the Lord I’m trusting one
That rules the range on high

And when He hears His own
Crying out in agony
The son will leave his throne
His angels He will bring with Him
And send them east and west
And north and south to gather in
The ones that stood the test

‘Twas battered and scarred and the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his while
To waste much time on the old violin
But he held it up with a smile.
What am I bidden, good folks, he cried
Who will start bidding for me?
A dollar, a dollar – then Two! Only two?
Two dollars, and who’ll make it three?
Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;
Going for three – But no
From the room far back a gray haired man
Came forward and picked up the bow;
Then wiping the dust from the old violin
And tightening the loose strings
He played a melody pure and sweet
As sweet as a caroling angel sings.
The music ceased and the auctioneer
With a voice that was quiet and low
Said What am I bidden for the old violin?
And he held it up with the bow.
A thousand dollars, and who’ll make it two?
Two thousand! And who’ll make it three?
Three thousand once; three thousand, twice;
And going, and gone! said he.
The people cheered and some of them cried
We do not understand What changed its worth?
Swift came the reply:
The touch of the master’s hand.
And many a man with life out of tune
And battered and scattered with sin
Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd
Much like the old violin. 
A “mess of pottage a glass of wine;
A game – and he travels on.
He’s “going” once and ” going” twice
He’s “going” and “almost gone.” 
But the Master comes and the foolish crowd
Never can quite understand
The worth of a soul and the change that’s wrought
By the touch of the Master’s hand.

   SOUNDS LIKE IT’S CRYING FOR THE SINGING BRAKEMAN TOO
   BACK TO THE SUNNY SOUTH HE’LL GO AND HE’LL NEVER ROAM NO MORE
   HERE COMES THE TRAIN CARRYING JIMMIE ROGERS HOME
COME HOME MY LITTLE SON AND LET ME HOLD YOU UP
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU ARE GROWN
HOW YOUR MAMA AND YOUR DAD WERE SO PROUD AND SO SAD
WATCHING THE TRAIN CARRYING JIMMIE ROGERS HOME

Where was you when the train left town
I’s standing on the corner with my head hung down
If I had my gun I’d let the hammer down
Lord I’d shoot that rounder took my girl from town
   Hey that train that carried my girl from town
   Hey hey hey hey
I wish to the Lord that the train would wreck
Kill that engineer and break the fireman’s neck
There goes the train that carried my girl from town
If I know’d her number boy I’d flag her down
Rations on the table and the coffee’s getting cold
Some dirty rounder stole my jelly roll
Hello Central give me 6 – 0 – 9
I wanta talk to that woman of mine
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Can you show me the woman that a man can trust
There goes my girl somebody bring her back
Cause she got her hand in my money sack

There’s an old broken lock on the old cabin door
The cracks and the holes in your cabin floor
It’s a tumbled down shack how I long to go back
And dwell in that shack evermore
   Peace peace the valley of peace
   Where no sorrows are known
   Like a heaven yes heaven to me it seems
   Peace the valley my home
Though an old broken window
the light brightly shines
It twinkles and shines through the honeysuckle vines
By the old rustic well is my sweet little Nell
And for me I know how she pines
In the parlor a fire is burning so bright
The old rocking chair is empty tonight
That tumbled down shack is a palace to me
And that’s where I’m longing to be

I thought I heard the voice of my darling
I looked but there was no one else around
Just when I knew her memory would haunt me
Just as long as I stay in this lonesome town
As I go walking down this lonely street
Thinking of a love that used to be
The one I love is gone and I’m so lonely
Then I thought I heard my baby speak to me
Is seems so long now since she went away
Although it was only yesterday
I see her face each time I try to sleep
And I hear her voice on every lonely street

   Oh the waves on the sea how they roll
   And the chilly winds how they do blow
   My own true love got drownded in the deep
   And the ship never got to the shore.
I left my darling grievin’
I left my darling grievin’
I left my darling grievin’ at the deep
And I never expect to see her anymore.
The first on the deck was the captain of the ship
A rough looking fellow was he
Said I care no more for my wife and my child
Than I do for the fish in the sea.
One cold night as I lay on my bed
I fell so fast asleep
And thoughts of my true love come runnin’ through my head
And poor sailors that sail on the deep.
Oh the moon shines so bright and the stars give us light
And my mother is waiting for me
She may look she may weep she may look to the deep
She may look to the bottom of the sea.
Then three times around turned the gallant old ship
Yes three times around turned she
And as she turned (the) third time around
She sank to the bottom of the sea.

There is a time for love and laughter
The days will pass like summer storms
The winter wind will follow after
But there is love and love is warm
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new the world is free
There is a time when leaves are fallin’
The woods are gray the paths are old
The snow will come when geese are callin’
You need a fire against the cold
So do your roaming in the springtime
And you’ll find your love in the summer sun
The frost will come and bring the harvest
And you can sleep when day is done

We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone thru
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do
She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home
As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she’d lay neath the ground
The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do
When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that’s the reason
That there was nothing we could do

Among the hills where the evergreens grow

Who is different from others I know
Now her irony-gray hair’s turned to silver
And her kind eyes are ever soft and blue
Always she has a kind word for others
And a smile ever waiting for you
She’s adored for her sunny disposition
By the women, the children and men
In all the neighboring hills they call her Mother
For she’s really a mother dear to them
She is cheerful like the birds in the cedars
She is modest like the songs that they sing
In the hills nearby they call her Mother
For she’s really a mother true to them
When the clouds hang low on the mountain
And the pines are bent low by the snow
Neighbors go to that store by the roadside
It’s a place that they all love to go
Some go there to play cards at the table
Some just sit by the warm, cheering fire
And dear Mother with kind disposition
Finds a way to make all happy there
She’s adored for her sunny disposition
By the women, the children and the men
In all the neighboring hills they call her Mother
For she’s really a mother dear to them

Hang down your head and cry
For we often lose some things in life
That makes us wonder why
Oh the fairest love I ever had
Now sleeps beneath the clay
I live in hopes and dreams of her
That we’ll meet again someday
I often sit and wonder why
Life has to be this way
But after all is said and done
I’m sure God has his say
I’d like to be a small part of life
With some few things to achieve
Just to know I’ve been a fruitless cause
Would give my poor heart grief
Now when they lower my casket down
In some lonesome grave to rest
And you take your last look at my face
You can say I done my best

I prayed that you’d stay here forever

In this wide wicked world ever met
For the pleasure we’ve both seen together

Now you may have friends on the ocean
And you may have some over the sea
But you’ll travel this whole wide world over
And you’ll never find a faithful friend like me
Like the birds that go out in the spring time
Just to wander for pleasure alone
While the sun shine is smiling upon them
But someday they return to their home
When the pleasures of life cease to call you
And you’re done with your wine and your song
Then come back to your home in the mountains
To the girl who’s been waiting so long

Bought and paid for by my own hand
Worth a fortune to a working man

And they’ll make you think that they love you well
And away they’ll go and court some other
And leave you there in grief to dwell
I wish I was on some tall mountain
Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
I’d write a letter to my false true lover
Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings to fly so high
I’d fly to the arms of my false true lover
And when he’d ask, I would deny
Oh love is handsome, love is charming
And love is pretty while it’s new
But love grows cold as love grows older
And fades away like morning dew

He could have been forgiven but he mocked the Lord instead
You say you are the Son of God they’ve nailed you to a tree
Come down come down and save us if God your Father be
Well the man on the right was a sinner but he was sorry for his sins
He begged the Lord’s forgiveness and Jesus said to him
Fear not fear not this earthly death before this day is o’er
You’ll be with me in paradise on Heaven’s golden shore

Throw down your earthly crown
Never mind how it sparkles and glows
The crown best worn is made of thorns
And from every thorn blooms a rose
From every thorn blooms a rose
Think not of earthly kings
Though they have precious stones and jewels
The one true king had none of these things
He had just a carpenter’s tools
He had just a carpenter’s tools
Think not of earthly queens
Though they might have wealth untold
Much more a queen was Mary Magdalene
She had a wealth in her soul
She had a wealth in her soul
Think not of palaces fair
And churches laden with gold
It was there in the market square
That all the lessons were told
All the lessons were told
Think not of the armies of man
The battles won and lost
THe cowardly man has blood on his hands
The brave man hangs from the cross
The brave man hangs from the cross
Throw down your earthly crown
Never mind how it sparkles and glows
The crown best worn is made of thorns
And from every thorn blooms a rose
From every thorn blooms a rose

In a little country village
I met a man and he was blind
As I helped him cross the highway
I cried thy burdens are greater than mine
   I can see the light of day
   And I need not feel my way
   Yes thy burdens
Saw a lad well on his travels
Trying hard to play the game
Though his leg was very crippled
And he could not speak his name
Still he smiled in understanding
Though life to him had been unkind
As I watched I thought in sorrow
Son thy burdens
   I can speak my name aloud
   Make my way among the crowd
   Yes thy burdens
Just by chance I passed a graveyard
Saw a young man kneeling there
In his hand there were some roses
On his lips there was a prayer
On a stone these words were written
My soul is God’s my memory thine
As I watched I thought in sorrow
Friends thy burdens
   I’m just a drifter all alone
   I got no friends I got no home
   Yes thy burdens …

Whenever you’re around me dear my heart just won’t stand still
And when it comes to kissing you I’ll never get my fill
They said I’d never settle down that I would always roam
That I could never be the type for a loving wife and home

He was just a little farm lad so busy at play
In his little playhouse down by the gate
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door
At the home of his tiny playmate
Then he saw his Daddy watching too
As the man swiftly walked to the cottage door
He knew they were strangers that come from the town
Men he had never seen before
They soon were at their work and he heard his Daddy say
Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no, he cried, dear God don’t let it be
They can’t take my sweetheart away
I know Dad that you don’t understand
How a heart so young could conceive a plan
I’m only seven now but it’s just like you say
Daddy someday I’ll be a man
The man who owns the farm where your playmate now lives
He told me it has to be this way
For winter time has come and their work is all done
And now they are moving away
Let us buy the farm so they can stay
Give them all my toys that dear Santa gave
And give him the pennies in my little bank
Pennies that my darling helped me save

You took her by the roadside
Where you begged to be excused

To make her your wife
You took her on the hillside
Where there you took her life
Take down my old violin
And play it all you please
At this time tomorrow
It’ll be no use to me
I dug a grave four feet long
I dug it three feet deep
And throwed the cold clay o’er her
And tramped it with my feet

How our simple little vows they were broken
And the love that I treasured more than gold
Are you tired of the life that you’re living
Does your mind wander back to the past
Do your think of the love you’ve forsaken
Darling true love is too sweet to last
I remember that night in the moonlight
when you said that you’d found someone new
do you realize the heartaches you caused me
you should know that my love was so true
Alone in sadness I’m traveling
I’m lost on the sea of regret
Wandering back to the place of my childhood
And the one I’ve always loved the best

Come pretty young girls give me your attention
To these few lines I’ve tried to write
About a man who I won’t mention
Who courted of his charming bride
And when her parents came to know him
They tried so hard both day and night
To separate here and her own true lover
Her and her own true hearts delight
She turned her back upon the city
She viewed the fields and meadows round
She came upon a broad river
And in the shade of a tree sat down
Her true love being not far behind
He heard her make a mournful sound
And looking on her lifeless body
As she lay cold upon the ground
He then took out his silver weapon
He pierced it through his tender heart
Sayin let this be a dreadful warning
For all true lovers that have to part

Nestled in the heart of the Tennessee hills
Midst peaceful pines ‘neath the rocks and the rills
There stands my old homestead of long years ago
Brings back sweet memories of the one I loved so
I courted a maiden so sweet and so fair
With pearly blue eyes and with chestnut brown hair
She promised to love and said she’s be mine
But I went away leaving her there behind
I’ll tell you the reason why I left her there
To roam this old world with its sorrow and cares
I saw her one night in the arms of a man
Hugging and kissing as true lovers can
I went to my home with a heart full of woe
Packed my belongings determined to go
For many long years this old world I did roam
With thoughts of my sweetheart my darling my own
While dining one day in a little country town
A stranger came in and he chanced to sit down
While talking of loved ones I happened to find
That his sister was that old sweetheart of mine
Now I am the man who you saw that fateful night
Wrapped in the arms of my sister so tight
She waited so long for the day you’d return
And why you had left her she never did learn
When he heard my story to me then he said
The one that you loved has a long time been dead
She loved you so dearly but you broke her heart
Poor stranger, from her ever more you must part

You tell me she’s wicked and maybe it’s true
But one thing I do know she’s no longer mine
Twenty-twenty vision and walking round blind
I’ve lost her I’ve lost her oh what shall I do
I’ll bet you’re not happy as she’s there with you
The eyes of your heart will have trouble like mine
Twenty twenty vision and walking round blind

Twilight is stealing over the sea
Shadows are falling dark on the lee
Born on the night winds voices of yore
Come from that far off shore
Far away beyond the starlit skies
Where the lovelight never never dies
Gleameth a mansion filled with delight
Sweet happy home so bright
Voices of loved ones songs of the past
Still linger round me while life shall last
Lonely I wander sadly I roam
Seeking a far off home
Come in the twilight come come to me
Bringing some message from over the sea
Cheering my pathway while here I roam
Seeking that far off home

I want two arms to hold me when I’m feelin’ blue
I want someone to love me with a love so true
I want two lips to kiss me as they use to do
I want two arms to hold me darlin’ I want you
I want two arms to hold me and never let me go
If you ever loved me my dear I want to know
Cause when I’m sad and lonely that’s when I want you so
I want two arms to hold me when I’m feelin’ low
You use to say you loved me you use to hold me tight
Now you leave me lonely to long for you at night
I want two arms to hold me that held me close before
The arms that use to hold me will reach for me no more
When shadows start to fallin’ and you’re alone and blue
You’ll want two arms to hold you that use to care for you
Just think about me darlin’ and this little song
You’ll want two arms to hold you and you may find me gone

I can’t undersand dear why you ever lied
The stars in the skies have tumbled below
Now my heart is breaking it’s beating so low
The moment you walked dear into my heart
What a wonderful meeting for two lonely hearts
You gave me your love to have and to hold
But something has happened you took the wrong road
You said you would love and you would obey
But the Golden Rule’s broken so go on your way
I’ve lost all the faith that I’ve had in you
So go on away dear you could never be true

I sit here and stare at the wall
I think of you sweetheart and days gone by
And I know two more years is all
   Two more years is all and I’ll be free
   And then we can start our lives anew
   I’ve held your memory so close to me

I’ve been in this old prison for nineteen years
It seems like ninety to me
Only twenty-four months of tears sweetheart
Two more years and I’ll be free

A crowd of young fellas one night at a ball
Were telling of sweethearts they’d had
All seemed hardy except one lad
Who seemed downhearted and sad
Come join us Ned his comrades then said
Surely some girl has loved you
Then raising his head proudly he said
I’m in love with two
   One has hair of silver gray
   The other one is just like gold
   One is young and youthful too
   The other is aged and old
   
   But dearer than life are they both to me
   From neither would I part
   One is my mother God bless her I love her
   The other one is my sweetheart
My sweetheart is a poor working girl
Whom I’m determined to wed
Father says no it will never be so
You must marry an heiress instead
Mother was young she knows how it is
When father met her she was poor
Ned don’t fret she’ll be your wife yet
For he will consent I am sure

   Late in the evening about sundown
   High on the hill and above the town
   Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
   You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
He played an old piece he called “Soldier’s Joy”
And the one called “The Boston Boy”
The greatest of all was “Jenny Lynn”
To me that’s where the fiddle begins

When Uncle Pen was called away
They hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow
They knew it was time for him to go

Someone whose love is not sincere

Alone, footloose and fancy free
Yet chained to a love they’ll never claim
And afraid to ever love again

It was in the time of autumn
The golden leaves lay all around
That we laid our dear old father
Away beneath the cold damp ground
   It seems but a short time ago
   That he was in his fullest bloom
   But death alas has laid him low
   Another victim to the tomb
Many sad farewells were given
Many bitter tears were shed
Our sad hearts all beat with anguish
As he lay on his dying bed
On a savior’s summons he was readied
On his journey home to go
And fearless drew near the dark valleys
Washed in His blood whiter than snow

To the times when I was free
As I played before the fireside
Round my darling mother’s knee
   There’s a blessed home up yonder
   Where my loved ones wait for me
   I saw mother in a vision
   Kneeling there to pray for me
Then one day our mother left us
Daddy said she’d gone to rest
I remember how she loved me
As she clutched me to her breast
Some sweet day I’ll meet you mother
Your little boy is coming home
To see you as in days of childhood
The one you loved and left alone

I was praying to God to redeem my poor soul
When I heard the sweet voice of my lovin’ Savior
And I started that night to make heaven my home

Someday when he calls I’ll go up to Heaven
And then in that city I’ll look on His face

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobos call
You’re traveling through the jungles on the Wabash Cannonball
Our eastern states are dandy, so the people always say
From New York to St Louis with Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball

And always be remembered through the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over, now the curtains round him fall
We’ll carry him home to victory on the Wabash Cannonball

Just about the age of ten

Toting water to the hard working men
Well the rich men make all the money
The poor man do all the work
The rich man living mighty high on the hog
Poor man live on the dirt
My old pappy told me
Just on thing to do
Find a good woman be good to her
And she gonna be good to you

Bout the hammer that weighed nine pounds

Was little John Henry Brown

Cast away on a big sailing ship
On the ocean we sailed far away
Rough seas and foul weather made long to the mast
Fearing they would not see the next day
I landed in some unknown country 
No money not even one friend
Wanderlust was the reason I travelled
On a journey that may have no end
I hear my dear mother calling
Her whisper the winds of the bay
Her song a cry for her lost son
While feeling her life pass away
So its memories I keep close beside me
To nourish my poor heardened soul
But I’ll work anywhere there’s some money
Many days have now taken their toll
How many more years will I travel
How many more years all alone
I’m bound to the place far behind me
To the home cross the great ocean foam 
There’s a thought each day that I’m workin
Of my home in a land ‘cross the sea
If I make enough money I’ll find my way back

For leaving me and staying gone so long

A home and a family left behind
Two little children crying all the time
All the things that we worked for didn’t mean that much to you
So how can I forgive you for what you’ve put me through
   You say you want to come back
   To our home upon the ridge
   There’s too much water underneath the bridge
The day you left I walked on down the road
The sky was gray and cloudy and the water looked so cold
At the crossing by the river, thought I’d take the easy way
Then I realized there’s people here that needed me to stay
   So I walked back up the hill

The moon and stars were shining bright
Storm come up and the trees come down
Tell you boys I was waterbound
Waterbound on a stranger’s shore
River rising to my door
Carried my home to the field below
Waterbound nowhere to go
Carved my name on an old barn wall
No one’d know I was there at all
Stables dry on a winter night
You turn your head you could see the light
Black cat crawling on an old box car
Rusty door and a falling star
Ain’t Got a dime in my rations sack
Waterbound and I can’t get back
It’s I’m gone and I won’t be back
Don’t believe me count my tracks
River’s long and the river’s wide
I’ll meet you boys on the other side
So say my name and don’t forget

See that watermelon a’hanging on the fence
How I wish that melon was mine
Some folks are foolish they just don’t have no sense
Or they wouldn’t leave that melon on the vine
   Hambone it is sweet chicken it is good
   Rabbit is so very very fine
   But give me oh give me oh how I wish you would
   That watermelon hanging on the vine
You may talk about your peaches your apples and your pears
Simmons growing on the tree
Folks have their favorites just most every where
But that watermelon is the best for me
I went to get that melon I thought I’d have some fun
The stars they had just begun to shine
But when I heard some moving I left there on the run
But I didn’t leave that melon on the vine

   Oh, the waves on the sea, how they roll
   And the chilly winds, how they do blow;
   My own true love got drownded in the deep
   And the ship never got to the shore
Oh the first on the deck was the porter of the ship
And a rough-looking fellow was he;
Says, ” I care no more for my wife and my child
Than I do for the fish in the sea”
Well, I left my dear darling a-grieving
Well, I left my dear darling a-grieving
Well, I left my dear darling a-grieving after me
For I never expect to see her any more

Willie don’t you rap no more

   No one to cry for me
I like the hills of West Virginia
I like the hills of Tennessee

And a dollar is all I crave
Ain’t brought nothing with me into this world
Ain’t gonna take nothing to the grave

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there’s no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
   I’m going there to see my father
   I’m going there no more to roam
   I’m only going over Jordan
   I’m only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather ’round me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God’s redeemed their vigils keep
I’m going there to see my mother
She said she’d meet me when I come
I’m only going over Jordan
I’m only going over home

I saw a wayward traveler in tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad
His back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone,
It [sic] shouted as he journeyed, ”Deliverance will come!”
 Then palms of victory, crowns of glory,
Palms of victory I shall wear
The summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow,
His garments worn and dusty, his step seemed very slow
But he kept pressing onward, for he was wending home,
Still shouting as he journeyed, “Deliverance will come!”
The songstress in the arbor, that stood beside the way,
Attracted his attention, inviting his delay
His watchword being “Onward!” he stopped his ears and ran,
Still shouting as he journeyed, ”Deliverance will come!”
While gazing on that city, just o’er that narrow flood,
A band of holy angels came from the throne of God
They bore him on their pinions, they bore the dashing foam,
And joined him in his triumph, “Deliverance has come!”

The moon cuts a path so deep in the mountains
It lights up the hills where we used to roam
Once again the moon shines and a tear rolls from my face
Once again the moon hides I’m in darkness alone
If I had but one chance dear God I would never
Leave my little darlin so cold and alone
My mind’ll be tormented I know now forever
Since they buried my heart ‘neath a weathered gray stone

Down the aisle with someone else you’re walking

I even bought a little band of gold

I hear the children laughing now with glee
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
How fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your fair
While the organ plays I Love You Truly

Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another
But wedding bells will never ring for me

I stepped up on a platform smoking a cheap cigar
Waiting to catch a freight train to catch an empty car

When in sorrow or despair

She will listen she’ll be there

She’s the nation’s shining sun
Don’t forget the prayers she taught you
You will need them where you are
Though her hair has turned to silver
Send her flowers sweet and fine
Drop a card or send a letter
She’ll be waiting she’ll be there
When her eyes are closed to slumber
Gently kiss her icy brow
Fold her hands upon her bosom
She will rest in Heaven now
When your days are dark and dreary
And your cross is hard to bear

Does he mention my name to you
If only my dreaming soul
Some token of love could find
If only a wave would show my where he sleeps
Then I’d leave this world behind
A beautiful rose one day
I placed on the crest of a wave

And lay it so it falls above his watery grave

Saying I’ll meet him above

But I’ve sinned ‘gainst my home and my loved ones
And now i must ever more roam
So she lights up the lamp and sits waiting
For she knows not the crime i have done
So I’ve changed all my ways and I’ll meet her
Up in heaven when life’s race is run.
 When it’s lamp lighting time in the valley
Still in dreams I go back to my home
Oh I can see that old lamp in the window
It will guide me wherever I roam

I know that Jesus will never forsake
His love will find a way
He’ll bridge the stream if his hand I will take
When he calls what can I say
   Day follows night night follows day
   Farther and farther I roam
   What will my answer be what can I say
   When Jesus beckons my home
Sometimes the clouds seem to cover his face
Sometimes the skies are so gray
Still by the stars and his wonderful grace
He’ll roll the storm clouds away

Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But some day they’ll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
   When my blue moon turns to gold again
   When the rainbow turns the clouds away
   When my blue moon turns to gold again
   You’ll be back within my arms to stay
The lips that used to thrill me so
Your kisses were meant for only me
In my dreams they live again, sweetheart
But my golden moon is just a memory
The castles we built of dreams together
Were the sweetest stories ever told
Maybe we will live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way
I was wretched and blind as could be
But my Savior in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me 
   When the Savior reached down for me
   When he reached way down for me
   I was lost and undone without God or his Son
   When he reached down his hand for me 
How my heart does rejoice when I hear his sweet voice
In the tempest to him I can cling
There to lean on his arm safe secure from all harm
When he reached down his hand for me

Darlin’, we are growing old
And show the silver in our hair
Since time has stolen all the gold
That made your youthful tresses fair
But years can never steal away
A look that never can grow old
What care we for tresses gray
Since love will always keep its gold
Love, I’ll tell you with a kiss
If Heaven gives back the youth we miss
Your face will be no fairer then
When silver threads are gold again
Darlin’, I can read today
The question in your thoughtful eyes
You wonder if I wish for May
Beneath the frosty autumn skies
Love of mine, be sure of this
For me, no face could be so fair
Than this one that I stoop to kiss
Beneath its crown of silver hair
Darlin’, with your hand in mine
We’ll journey all life’s pathway through
With happy tears your dear eyes shine
Like deep blue blossoms in the dew
The sorrow of the passing years
Have made us love each other more
And every day that disappears
I count you dearer than before
Love, I’ll tell you with a kiss
If Heaven gives back the youth we miss
Your face will be no fairer then
When silver threads are gold again

Friends and loved ones I must leave
For tomorrow I’ll be lifted
When the angels come for me
When the angels come to get me
In a chariot of pure gold
I’ll be carried up to heaven
On that hallelujah road
Life down here has been so happy
Through this world which I’ve trod
But I’ll move into a mansion
Where I’ll dwell forever more
There I’ll be with my dear Savior
Dad and Mother I will see
All these joys will be mine forever

By the mill stream sits the Miller’s pretty daughter
Her cheeks are like the first red rose of June
Her sweet voice sounds just like the rippling water
As so tenderly she hums an old love tune
But soon her song of joy has turned to sorrow
Her sweetheart now has come to say goodbye
She thinks of a sad and lonely morrow
And he hugs her as she murmers with a sigh
   When the bees are in the hive and the honey in the comb
   And the golden sunlight bends to kiss the dew
   While the old mill wheel turns ’round I love you Mary
   And when the bees are in the hive I’ll come to you
By the old mill sits the lonely maid repining
And her face was like the spring rose far away
While she looked down in the silver waters shining
And she sees her golden locks are dimmed with grey
Long years she’s waited there for his returning
All in vain she’s thinking he’ll come back someday
For the lamp of hope still in her heart is burning
As the old mill wheel turns ’round it seems to say

Ain’t got a worry but then
The people who say I’m carefree and gay
Don’t know how I’m lonely when the bright lights grow dim
People think cause I’m laughing the past is behind
But they don’t know the sorrow within’
A heart that is hurtin’ in a man bound by pride
Who cries for an old love when the bright lights grow dim
When the party has ended the laughter has died
And I think of our parting again
The smile leaves my face and tears take its place
I cry for you darling when the bright lights grow dim
So until you return I’ll keep wearing a mask
That will hide how I’m feeling within
So if your lonely too I’ll be right there with you
I’ll be thinking of you dear when the bright lights grow dim

He will wipe away my tears
He will blind me to all my fears

She knows that I’ll return to the mountains
And will bring to her a wedding ring

The ground will soon be covered white with snow
How I long to keep the home fires burning
For I know my darling needs me so

On a happy by and by
On a summer over yonder
With joy to you and I
Do not borrow grief or sorrow
In the hours that yet remain
We shall know of that tomorrow
When the roses come again
Sunshine over clover
Blossom on the meadow wide
Some I finger sweet to linger
Everywhere on every side
Someone’s roaming in the gloaming
Happy hearts that feel no pain
All their sadness turned to gladness
Now the roses come again

It’s one my family rode in back in the good old days
People loved their neighbors everybody was so free
And riding in a brand new wagon was something to see
I can still see my Daddy sitting on the wagon seat
Mom in her old sun bonnet she looked so nice and neat
Kids were all in the wagon Grandma and Grandpa too
Oh we used to go to church on Sunday when the wagon was new
Red wheels were on the wagon and the body it was green
We were all so happy as riding in a limousine
People used to gather round through all the mountain side
Take a look at the brand new wagon and all take a ride
Well the automobiles are here now the wagon days are through
Airplanes are a-humming neighbors are so few
Everybody’s in a hurry it’s money that takes you through
But we didn’t need much money when the wagon was new

You’ll find souls wandering out in darkness
Whose place in life they’ll never find
Wandering so aimless and hopelessly

You won’t find the stars in the honky-tonk and bars
Go home to your woman’s loving arms

But your lips are still tender thrilling and warm
Each day of life our love seems to grow
But where oh where did our young years go

Distant hills alone no more to be
And the city is a ragin’ fire
Cast about upon the lone prairie

What is left of the wild and free
Is the seed upon the wind and the waves upon the sea
The dust of dreams that could be brought
To every Oklahoma child
Is the dust below the buffalo
That lies still beneath the highway miles
Where rivers flow the path a tortured road
Promised angels from desert land
Mighty waters just a name and a dream

Round my home among the hills

While I sit and sadly ponder
And my heart with longing fills
As I often think of one that I love best
We were wedded in the springtime
And our hearts they knew no pain
Fair nature seemed to smile on us that day
Now she sleeps beneath the lilacs
And she’ll ne’er come back again
Where the silver Colorado wends its way

   And a sigh comes from the trees
   And the mocking birds they sing a sadder way
   For the flowers creep no more
   Round my cheerless cabin door
   Where the silver Colorado wends its way
The silver snow is gleaming
On your distant mountainside
Where often used to wander Nell and I
And the birds are singing gaily
In the valley far below
Where I long some day to lay me down and die
Then our lives were gay and happy
In the shadow of the hills
My heart beats fonder for her day by day
And I feel her presence near me
As I sit alone tonight
Where the silver Colorado wends its way

In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia
There’s a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell
   White dove will mourn in sorrow
   The willows will hang their heads
   I’ll live my life in sorrow
   Since mother and daddy are dead
We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful little mountain home
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great white throne
As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the graveyard
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray

McKinley hollered , McKinley squalled
Doc said “McKinley I can’t find the cause
You’re bound to die, you’re bound to die
Doc told the horse, he’d throw down his rein
He said to the horse you gotta outrun this train
From Buffalo to Washington
The doc came a-running, he took off his specs
Said “Mr Mckinley better cash in your checks
You’ve bound to die, you’re bound to die
Look here, you rascal, you see what you’ve done
Shot down my husband and I’ve got your gun
I’m carrying you back, to Washington
Well, Roosevelt’s in the White House, doing his best
McKinley’s in the graveyard taking his rest
He’s gone, for a long time

   Who can blame you though your heart’s untrue
   When you say it’s my fault anyway
   Turn your head from the tears I’ve shed
   Though your heart is untrue who can blame you
You justify yourself in your love for someone else
When you say I never loved you anyway
Your vows were made in vain although mine have still remained
Though you broke my heart in two who can blame you
In a heart of rusted steel you kept your love affair concealed
‘Til the day she was askin’ you to stay
Turn your head from the tears I’ve shed
Though you broke a heart in two who can blame you

   So when you find your all alone just ask yourself who done it
There was a time when you were mine and I belonged to you
You broke your vow so listen now while I give you a clue
I gave my heart to someone new because you tried to shun it
You want it back but its to late and your the one who done it
I offered you a bungalow with roses round the door
A diamond ring and everything but still you wanted more
You wanted to run your own life so I just let you run it
And when your dream train jumped the track I guess you know who done it

   Who will tend my hearts dear space

There’s a lovely green nook by a clear-running stream
It was my place when I was quite small
And it’s creatures and sounds could soothe my worst pains
But today they don’t ease me at all
In my grandfather’s shed there are hundreds of tools
I know them by feel and by name
And like parts of my body they’ve patched this old place
When I move them they won’t be the same
Now I wander around touching each blessed thing
The chimney the tables the trees
And my memories swirl ’round me like birds on the wing
When I leave here oh who will I be

Oh this life that I’m living, it seems so unforgiving

In waters that are cool as fallen snow
But the waters are oh so deep, what you sew you must reap
Now I hear a knocking at my door
It’s evil standing outside, there’s no place to run and hide
It plucks my soul and presses me to the floor
Oh I’ve been down that pathway, it always leads the wrong way

Feels like a freight train pulling me, there’s a dark tunnel ahead I see
This train’s going down a one-way track

She’s been the ruin of many a lover

Awake, awake, don’t wake my father

In the beautiful hills way back in Virginia
By the side of his home where he played as a lad
In a deep dark grave Carter lies sleeping
There lies the best friend that I ever had
For twenty one years he travelled this country
Entertaining his friends wherever he roamed
For many thousands he made life brighter
Now he is at rest near his old home
He wrote many songs about the Clinch Mountains
Of mother and dad his friends and home
Through 43 states and many foreign countries
Wherever he travelled his name was known
Now he’s at rest in the family graveyard
On top of a hill where the wind blows o’er
he’s gone on now but he won’t be forgotten
The songs he left will never grow old
He laid down his guitar but he’ll always be remembered
On earth for the last time he sung white dove
Forever in heaven Carter will be singing
Singing with the angels in heaven above

I’ve seen love fade away
I’ve had tears from sadness
Like those shed today 
My heart was within me
My sadness my own
My thoughts there were anchored
At rest with my soul
 
Then when I met you
I gave you my soul
My heart was between us
No longer my own
All that I know of
And all that I am
Is shared now with you
How can I remain
   
    Oh lord if you’re with me
    Help me find the strength
    My soul lay a-dying
    Why must I remain
And now you are dying
Now you are alone
And I must remain here
Though my world  is gone
And I am no longer
My heart has no home
There could be no other, God
Don’t leave me alone

I once loved a beautiful maiden
As fair as the blue skies above
And each night as we wondered together
The moon seemed to smile on our love
We vowed to be true to each other
And nothing could cause us to part
But we never once dreamed that the future
Held only a broken heart
Then there came the night when we parted
We quarreled as all sweethearts do
And I learned what it was to be jealous
When she told me our love was untrue
She told me she had always been faithful
She swore that her love could not die
And then when I did not believe her
She kissed me and told me goodbye
Yodel
I found I had falsely accused her
And went back to make her my bride
And there in the door stood her mother
She told me my sweetheart had died
I went in and knelt down beside her
And there in the hush of that room
I prayed that my maker would take me
And send my soul down to its doom
So now I have told you the reason
There’s always a tear in my eye
For long weary years I’ve repented
But I’m longing to lay down and die
And I wonder if I’ll be forgiven
When I face the master someday
And I wonder if I’ll see my sweetheart
On that beautiful shore far away

She went back to Wichita
She went back to her ma and pa
Reckon I saw her next to my truck
Pumping gas with the car packed up.
We talked as neighbors will
There waiting for the tanks to fill
We talked about nothing
how it might snow
How far she had to go.
   Going back where the grass grows tall
   And the fields burn in the fall
   You can still hear the night birds call
   Back in Wichita.
She came in ’85
She came here as a July bride
But it never got easy
never got rich
Ain’t got much but what she came here with.
Good times have all been spent
She ain’t broken but she’s badly bent
There’s nothing she wants here
nothing that shines
She’s made up her mind.
She says for all my time
well I ain’t got much to show
You can tell that man of mine and anyone who wants to know
Going back where the grass grows tall
And the fields burn in the fall
You can still hear the night birds call
Back in Wichita.

Too old to be controlled

And I destroyed that poor boy’s soul

And then he gave one dying moan
He wrapped his arms around my little girl’s neck

So put them handcuffs on me boys
And lead me to that freight car gate
I have no friends or relations there
No-one for to go my bail
So pass around that old long necked bottle
And we’ll all go on a spree

And tomorrow will be the last of me

Til the roses bloom again
She was faithful to her lover
She was true until the end
Though she knew not what befell him

In a cold and cheerless garret
In a room so dim so lone
In the frosty winter in silence
There was heard a little mourn
And a little child is asking
At the break of the day
Will the roses bloom in heaven
Tell me momma tell me pray
   
   Will the roses bloom in heaven
   Are there any gardens there
   Any violets and clover
   Way up with the angels there
   
   Will the branches fill with blossoms
   And in winter fill with snow
   Will the roses bloom in heaven
   Tell me momma ere I go
Now the room grows light and lighter
Every thing has caught a glow
Heaven seems to stretch about her
While dreams they just come and go
Then she whispered birds are singing
Songs of melody
And I see the roses blooming
While the angels beckon me
Then mother whispered
In the land so bright and fair
When the roses are blooming
There will be no parting there
Goodbye my little darling
For death is lingering here
And on the little pale face
There was not one trace of fear

I am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down
When through wonderful grace by my Savior I stand
Will there be any stars in my crown
   Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
   When at evening the sun goeth down
   When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
   Will there be any stars in my crown
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When His praise like the sea billow rolls
O what joy it will be when His face I behold
Living gems at His feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown

How would you like feeling lonesome
When someone is through with you
My heart is sad and I’m lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
Don’t want you to cry cause I’m leaving
Don’t want you to cry cause I’m blue
Only my thoughts make me lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
Why should two lovers quarrel
Why should they be so untrue
I know what it means to be lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
No one to love me little darling
Nothing but memories of you
When I’m far away I’ll be lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
Give me your right hand honey
I’ll say this farewell to you
I’ll be so lonesome without you
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too

When I’m in some other land?
And you know I can’t be with you
Or will you be loving another man? 
   Will you be loving another man
   Will you be loving another man
   When I return will you be waiting
   Or will you be loving another man
Now don’t be crying on my shoulder
And telling me that love is grand
And before I’m out of sight dear
Then be loving another man
Now if I find this to be true dear
I want you to please understand
When I return don’t say you’re sorry
Just keep on loving another man

Willie Moore was a king his age twenty-one
And he courted a damsel fair
Oh her eyes were as bright as the diamonds after night
And wavy black was her hair
He courted her both night and day
Till on marry they did agree
But when he came to get her parents’ consent
They said that could never be
She threw herself in Willie Moore’s arms
As oft time had done before
But little did he think when they parted that night
Sweet Anna he would see no more.
Oh it was about the tenth of May
The time I remember well
That very same night her body disappeared
In a way no tongue could tell
Sweet Anna was loved both far and near
Had friends most all around
And in a little brook before the cottage door
The body of sweet Anna was found
She was taken by her weeping friends
And carried to her parent’s room
And there she was dressed in a shroud of snowy white
And laid in a lonely tomb
Her parents now are left alone
One mourns while the other weeps
Beneath a grassy mound before the cottage door
The body of sweet Anna sleeps
Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say
And at last from them all he did part
And the last heard from him he was in Montreal
Where he died of a broken heart

He don’t know what it is to play
Each night before he goes to bed
This little prayer he always says
Now I lay me down to rest
Please God please give me happiness
I’m prayin’ so my dreams come true
So I can walk and play with you
His name they call him Willie Roy
He’s just a little crippled boy
But now the tears roll down his cheek
I rub them off so he can sleep
Someday I hope you can go out
And play with me and walk about
I won’t scold you if you should cry
So son be good my son good night

Oh give to me a winding stream
It must not be too wide
Where waving leaves from maple trees
Do meet from either side
The water must be deep enough
To float a small canoe
With no one else but you
   Do not disturb
   My waking dream
   The splendor of
   That winding stream
   Flower in my canoe
   Her eyes they looked me through
   A maiden fair
   With golden hair
   Is very much like you
The sparkling trout
Beneath the bank
Does leave his hiding place
King fisher
From the bow above
So eager to give chase
The spreading branches
Overhead
The sunlight peeking through
When looking dear at you

    I’ll just let the wind blow them by
I how I love the sound of the wind when it’s howlin
For it blows my blues away
It makes me forget the girl that I’m lovin
Lets me forget until another day
Let me hear the leaves on the trees when they are singing
Just a moment of relief is all care
For I’ve got no sorrow heartaches or sadness
As long as I can see the trees that sway
Oh, my friends bury me a way up on the mountain
Where that old wind will always blow
For I want to rest alone on the mountain
With the howlin wind that I love so
Tell my old lover in care you should see her
Just how much I love her she’ll never know
And that I’ve gone to rest away upon the mountain
Where the howling wind will always blow

To see the Jesus in the manger
The pathway lighted by the stars

And the rocks all melt in the sun

Along came the FFV, the fastest on the line,
Running along the C and O Road, twenty minutes behind the time
Running into Sewall Yard, was quartered on the line
Awaiting their strict orders to bring her in on time
And when she blew for Hinton, her engineer was there
George Alley was his name, with bright and wavy hair
His fireman, Jack Dickerson, was standing by his side
Receiving their strict orders, and in the cab to ride
George Alley’s mother came to him with a basket on her arm
She handed him a letter saying “Be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life trying to make up lost time
But if you run your engine right you’ll get there just on time”
George Alley said, “Dear mother, your letter I’ll take heed
I know my engine is all right and I know that she will speed
So o’er this road I mean to run with speed unknown to all
And when I blow for Clifton Forge, they’ll surely hear my call
George Alley said to his fireman, “Jack, a little extra steam;
I intend to run old Number 4 the fastest ever seen;
So o’er this road I mean to fly like angels’ wings unfurled,
And when I blow for the Big Bend Tunnel, they’ll surely hear my call”
George Alley said to his fireman, “Jack, a rock ahead I see,
And I know that death is lurking there for to grab both you and me
So from this cab, dear Jack do fly, your darling life to save
For I want you to be an engineer while I’m sleeping in my grave”
“Oh no, dear George! That will not do, I want to die with you”
“Oh no, dear Jack, that will not be; I’ll die for you and me”
So from the cab poor Jack did leap, New River was running high,
And he kissed his hand to George as Number 4 flew by
So up the road she dashed, against the rock she crashed
The engine turning upside down, and the coaches coming last
George Alley’s head in the firebox lay, while the burning flames rolled high
“I’m glad I was born an engineer, on the C and O road to die”
George Alley’s mother came to him and in sorrow she did sigh
When she looked upon her darling boy and saw that he must die
“Too late, too late, dear mother! my doom is almost o’er
And I know that God will let me in when I reach that golden shore”
The doctor said, “Dear George, O darling boy, be still
Your life may yet be spared, if it is God’s blessed will”
“Oh no, dear doc, that cannot be, I want to die so free
I want to die on the engine I love, 143″
The doctor said, “Dear George, your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad, and laid in a lonesome grave”
His face was covered up with blood, his eyes they could not see
And the very last words that ever he spoke were, “Nearer my God to Thee”

Well, they gave him his orders in Monroe, Virginia
Saying Steve you are way behind time
This is not thirty eight, but it’s old ninety seven
You must put her into Spencer on time
He turned and said to his tired greasy fireman
Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross the White Oak Mountain
You can watch old Ninety-Seven roll
It’s a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
On a line on a three mile grade
It was on this grade that he lost his leverage
You can see what a jump he made
He was going down the grade making ninety miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
They found him in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
He was scalded to death by the steam
Now all you ladies you must take warning
From this time now on learn
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband
He may leave you and never return

And a picture was stamped on my heart
There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction
But I didn’t hear nobody pray

And desert me for so long?
Well you’re tellin’ everyone what you done

Well, listen honey you done me wrong.

Whispering softly these words so divine

Tell me your love me and say you’ll be true
I’ll love nobody in this world like you
Your heart and my heart in love will entwine
You give me your love and I’ll give you mine

A question of love a groom and a bride
And if you refuse me my heart it will pine

Said she must be going on her way
There’s better things on down the line
And I’ll not try to change her mind
She seems to think we’re better off this way
   But my heart it breaks in two
   I can’t believe that it’s true
   Though I want you to stay you’re leaving anyway
   You gotta do what you gotta do
There’s times that I know I’ve not been there for you
Maybe that’s the reason for your leaving
I’ll try to keep you off my mind
’cause a girl like you is hard to find
Somehow I’ll just have to stop my grieving
I guess it would be better if I’d never known your love
Then I wouldn’t know just what I’m missing
But I’ve seen that look in your eye and now it comes as no surprise
That another’s lips soon you will be kissing

That’s the place where I trace my bloodline
And it’s there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive
Oh my granddad’s dad walked down Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said won’t you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we’ll never leave Harlan alive

    And the sun goes down about three in the day
    And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinking
    And you spend your life just thinkin’ of how to get away
No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
‘Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills he said I’ll pay ya for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive
Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig laughed and sang a new song
Who said we’d never leave Harlan alive
But the times got hard and tobacco wasn’t selling
And ole granddad knew what he’d do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal and sent the money back to granny

There lived a maiden fair
Whose life was pure as heaven
Whose life was free from care
She dreamed of love and romance
With heart so glad and free
No gloom within the future
Young Freda Bolt could see
Nearby lived dear young Harmon
A boy she loved so well
And of these two young lovers
A story I will tell
Twas late one Thursday evening
The stars were shinning dim
That dear one called his sweetheart
To come and go with him
He told her on tomorrow
That they would surely wed
But little was she thinking
He’d take her life instead
They motored to Clinch Mountain
A place so dark and lone
And there her form so helpless
He placed beneath the stones
Away from home and mother
That Freda loved so well
The bitter pain and anguish
No mortal tongue can tell
Through tears she pled for mercy
Though he denied her cry
Young Harmon left his sweetheart
In agony to die
We think that God in heaven
Must surely heard her cry
And sent a band of angels
To linger very nigh
And bare her spirit over
To yonder happy shore
Where dying comes no never
And parting is no more

Love to you was just a past time
I’ll always love you even though it’s wrong
I’ll be better off without when I know you’re gone

To make sure that you’ve made up your mind
You’re expecting me to understand

How long can this go on

And running wild
You’re always gone
My love you never share
It’s more than I can bear
You’re running wild
   You’ll settle down someday
   And find I’ve gone away
   You’ll think of what you’ve done
   While running wild
I can’t go on
You’ll have to choose the way
You’ll have to go or stay
Stop running wild
You’re running wild

There awaits for me a glad tomorrow
Where the gates of pearl swing open wide
And when I have passed this spell of sorrow
I will camp upon the other side
   Someday beyond the reach of mortal kin
   Someday God only knows just where or when
   The wills of mortal life will all stand still
   And I shall go dwell on Zion’s Hill
Someday the storm clouds will be lifted
Beyond the shadow of the tomb
And with all the bells of Heaven ringing
And the angels singing “Home Sweet Home”

Well you said you wouldn’t leave me ’cause you didn’t want to grieve me
And you couldn’t stand to see tears in my eyes
But you said you loved another and it ain’t like he’s your brother
So I guess it’s time for me to realize
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
Well I think that I’ll surrender you keep looking out the windows
And it’s plain that you don’t love me any way
All you do is walk and piddle while I’m playing second fiddle
I don’t think that I can stand another day
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
For a long time I’ve been knowin’ in your eyes it’s all been showin’
And I knew some day someone would take my place
These cold kisses you’ve been givin’ and the way that we’ve been livin’
There’s enough to make a man start turning grey
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t braggin’
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon

There was only one thing that could make me glad
A good bunch of biscuits a good batch of biscuits
Mama could make mighty good gravy
And there was never no buts nor maybes
We’d get biscuits a good bunch of biscuits
Papa didn’t cuss but just a little bit
But if mama didn’t cook ’em he’d throw a big fit
Pass me them biscuits those High Life biscuits
And us little kids all sixteen of us
If mama didn’t make ’em you could hear us fuss
I want another biscuit a good bunch of biscuits
Three times a day seven days a week
We just couldn’t resist it
Clean up the plate that was our fate;
We didn’t leave a solitary biscuit
I don’t see how mama ever did make ’em
Enough to keep up with the way we ate ’em
A good bunch of biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits
I love a man sop red-eyed gravy
With a biscuit so light it’ll drive you crazy
A good bunch of biscuits a good bunch of biscuits
Most of us kids had our fingernails nipped
It was caused by grabbin’ them hot-fried biscuits
Goodness gracious they’re good biscuits
I turned eighteen I got me a wife
Oughtta be slapped for it the rest of my life
But I got biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits
If I ever get rich we’ll have a lot more
But I’ll keep eatin’ just like I was before
Goodness gracious they’re good biscuits
A good bunch of biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits
Goodness gracious I got biscuits

I was driving down a lonely road one dark and stormy night
When a little girl by the roadside showed up in my headlights
I stopped and she got in back and in a shaky tone
She said: My name is Mary, please won’t you take me home? 
She must have been so frightened all alone there in the night
There was something strange about her, for her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet in the back seat all alone
I’ll never will forget that night I took Mary home
I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes ’cause the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn’t there
A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then a lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said: It sure was nice of you to go out of your way
But thirteen years ago today a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shone
You’re the thirteenth one who’s been here bringing Mary home

I’m a broken down tramp without money
My clothes are all tattered and torn
And I am so sad and so lonely
I wish I had never been born
All through this wide world I have wandered
Inquiring for something to do
But whenever I ask for a job of work
They say they have none for a tramp
Now drink was the cause of my downfall
And the money I had I’ve outrun
And the friends that were mine when I had it
Now pass by and call me a bum
Now don’t be too hasty to judge me
As I drift along with the tide
My clothes may be ragged and dirty
But a clean heart is beating inside
One night on a dark lonely railroad
A hobo all hungry and cold
Saw an empty boxcar on the siding
He climbed in and closed up the door
Six months he had rode on the railway
When the brakeman came ’round with his light
He was shoved from the car and was killed by the train
Because he was only a tramp
Now young men, let this be a warning
For all you who long for the road
Better stick to the straight life and don’t be like me
A poor bum to die in the cold

They were standing by the window
On the night he kissed her cheek
He had waited long in silence
Waited long for her to speak
When at last he whispered softly
As the cool breeze kissed her head
She had waited long to tell him
What they told her he had said
Oh they say you love another
That you never did love me
If these words be true my darling
I’ll forever set you free
They are true he hardly answered
As the sun and stars above
When they told you my intentions
Then they told you of my love
He turned deathly pale and angry
Left her standing by the gate
Sent a message by her sister
But the message came too late
God in Heaven sent an Angel
To relieve her ache and pain
She went drifting off to Heaven
On an Angel’s snow white wing
He was standing by her casket
As he looked upon her face
Then he realized he loved her
And no one could take her place

   Without the help of God or man
   Than be a broken hearted lover
   When I have done the best I can
I thought that you were an angel
When I first looked into your eyes
But now I know all about you
I know your home’s not in the skies
Stop, look and listen for that whistle
And when you hear that lonesome sound
You’ll know by the whistle of that freight train
Your broken hearted lover’s gone

I traveled to Kentucky to court a fair young girl
Whose eyes were of the darkest brown and her hair had a charming curl
She had the sweetest lips to kiss that I had ever found
And she made me feel as if I was the only man around
Some people think of horses when you talk of the Bluegrass State
Others think their bourbon is what makes it so great
But the reason that the Bluegrass State stands in my memory
Is that brown eyed Kentucky girl she means so much to me
I remember very clearly it was on a warm spring night
We declared we loved each other and to marry would be right
It was a short time later in the month of July
Our lives were joined together we were one she and I
Many years have come and gone since the day that we met
Our love has grown much stronger and it is growing yet
We have a happy home and children we have three
We still enjoy each other this Kentucky girl and me

Way up on old Linville Mountain
Where the bear and the catamount reign
A strange ghostly light appears every night
Which no scientist or hunter can explain.
In the days of the old covered wagon
When they camped on the flats for the night
With the moon shinin’ dim o’er the old canyon rim
They watched for that brown mountain light.
High on the mountain
And down in the valley below
It shines like the crown of an angel
And fades as the mists come and go
Way over yonder
Night after night until dawn
A faithful old slave comes back from the grave
Is searching for his master who’s long gone.
Many years ago a southern planter
Came huntin’ in this wide world alone
Then so they say the hunter lost his way
And never returned to his home.
His trusting ol’ slave brought a lantern
And searched but in vain day and night
Now the ol’ slave is gone
but his spirit lingers on
And the lantern it still casts it’s light.

While watchin the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to me eye
I know that my life’s been a failure
Just watchin’ the bubbles in my beer.
I’m seeing the road that I’ve traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
I’m seeing the past that I’ve wasted

And of the golden chances that have passed me by
The dreams I once made now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer.

   We were buddies in the saddle,
   We were buddies in our home,
   We were buddies herding cattle,
   We were buddies everywhere we roamed
I’ll ne’er forget the day I found him,
He was so weak he could not speak
I’ll ne’er forget the smile he gave me,
Then the poor boy fell asleep
I took him up in my saddle
And carried him across the plain
My mother nursed him every moment
To try to make him well again
I’ve never had a pal so near me,
He took the blame for everything
I’d die for him just any moment,
And for me he’d do the same
But now by buddy’s gone and left me,
And it’s so hard to struggle ‘long
So hard to believe that he has left me,
I can’t realize that he has gone

On his dying bed at the close of day
He’d wasted time til upon his brow

He thought of his home and his friends so nigh
Oh the cowboys gathered to see him die
I fancy I’ll listen to the well known word
Of the free wild wind and the song of birds
He thought of his home and the cottonwood there
And the songs her learned in his childhood hour

In the old churchyard by the green hillside
By the side of my father let my grave be
O bury me not on the lone prairie
O bury me not on the lone prairie
Where the wild coyotes may howl over me
Where the buffalo roams and the winds blow free
O bury me not on the lone prairie
I want to be laid where mothers prayers
And sisters tears will mingle there
Where friends will come and weep over me
O bury me not on the lone prairie
O bury me not and his voice fell there
We heeded not his dying prayer
In a narrow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairie
We buried him there on the lone prairie
Where the buzzards fly and the wind blows free
Where rattlesnakes rattle and the tumbleweeds
Blow across his grave on the lone prairie

   Dearest girl in this whole wide world to me
   Every night of her I’m dreamin’
   In a cabin on a mountain far away In Tennessee.
Now my ramblin’ days are over for tonight I’m on my way
To that cabin on a mountain in Tennessee so far away
I searched this wide world over sailed upon the deep blue sea

There’s a happy childhood home in my memory I can see
Standing out upon the hill ‘neath the shadow of the tree
If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill.
 Oh I want to wander back to the cabin on the hill
‘Neath the shadow of the tree I would like to linger still
Just to be with those I love joy my heart would over fill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill
But the saddest of it all I can never more return
To that happy childhood home matters not how much I yearn
If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill

My driftin’ memory goes back to the spring of ’43
When I was just a child in Mama’s arms
My Daddy plowed the ground and prayed
that some day he could leave
This run down mortgaged workload of a farm.
Then one night I heard my Daddy saying to my Mama
That he’d finally saved enough to go
California was his dream for paradise that he had seen
In pictures in magazines that told him so
   California Cotton fields
   Where labor towns were filled with great men with broken dreams
   California cotton fields
   As close to wealth as Daddy ever came
Almost everything we had was sold or left behind
From Daddy’s belt to the fruit that Mama canned
Some folks came to say farewell and to see what all we had to sell
Some just came to shake my Daddy’s hand.
The Model A was loaded down and California bound
And good luck was just about four days away
The only change that I recall happening to my Daddy
Was when his dark hair turned to silver gray.

Don’t try to follow I can’t be found

And the only worry that I have’s in the sole of my shoe.
They caught me bummin’ in the park one day
You saw me thumbin’ on the old highway
Well listen baby don’t you know
That your dear old daddy’s got a home every where I go.
Well you took my money and my big fine farm
You thought you’d beat me but you didn’t by far
Well the big boys got me oh but I got away
And you’re gonna miss your dear old daddy some of these days.
Just need to follow that old black crow
Happy-go-lucky every where I go
Ain’t got no worries ain’t got no cares
An easy road and a lonesome road is all I share.

Said she’d known me a long time
And she talked of being in love
With every mountain she had climbed
And she talked of trails she’d walked up
Far above the timberline
From that night on I knew I’d write songs
For Carolina in the pines.
There’s a full moon on the fourteenth
First quarter twenty-first
And a full moon in the last week
Brings a fullness to the earth.
There’s no guess work in the clockwork
Of the world’s heart or mine
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines.
As the frost grows on the windows
The wood stove smokes and glows
As the fire glows we can warm our souls
Makin’ rainbows in the coals.
And we talk of trails we walk up
Far above the timberline
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines.

I’m a long way from home
I miss that love of mine broken windows empty doors
Nobody lives here anymore
Old memories come whistling like the wind
Through the walls and the cracked window panes
And the grass is growing high around the kitchen door
Nobody lives here anymore
Once there were children and a few hired hands
A hard working woman and a bone tired man
Now that old sun steals across a dusty floor
Nobody lives here anymore

And head down to Torny creek

O thought I heard my true love say
O do turn and come this way 
You love some other and you don’t love me
You care not for my company
You love some other and I know why
Because he has more gold than I
But gold will melt and silver will fly
My love for you will never die 
There is a flower I’ve heard them say
That can be seen from day to day
And if that flower I only could find
To cure this aching heart of mine 
So fare you well my charming little love

Heard the firemane say ” Boy you got a white-eye “

That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones

He said to fireman ” Boy you better jump
Cause there’s two locomotives and they’re bound to bump”

Lord they put me in the jailhouse, for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict, I was a guilty man
He said forty-five dollars, or thirty days in the can
   And that’ll be cash on the barrelhead, son
   You can take your choice, you’re twenty-one
   No money down, no credit plan
   No time to chase you, ’cause I’m a busy man
Found a telephone number, on a laundry slip
Had a kind-hearted jailer, with a six-gun hip
He let me call long-distance, She said, “Number, please?”
No sooner than I told her, she hollered out at me
   That’ll be cash on the barrelhead, son
   Not part, not half, but the entire sum
   No money down, no credit plan
   ‘Cause a little bird tells me that you’re a traveling man
Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry, my feet a heavy load
Saw a Greyhound a coming, stuck up my thumb
Just as I’d been seated, the driver caught my arm
   That’ll be cash on the barrelhead son
   This old gray dog, gets paid to run
   When engine starts, oh the wheels won’t roll

And the time so long ago
Where the sweet magnolias blossom
Cotton fields as white as snow.
Catfish John was a river hobo
Lived and died on the river bend
Lookin’ back I still remember

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
Still he never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear.

And on her I placed my whole heart’s delight;
I courted her for love, and her love I did obtain
Do you think I’ve any reason of love to complain?
But when her old father came this for to know
That me and his daughter together would go,
They locked her up and kept her so severe
That I never got sight but once more of Molly, my dear
And then I was forced to her father’s to go
To see whether my true love had forgot me, yes or no,
She made me this reply with the tears all in her eyes
I never will forget you until the day I die
Although they keep me so tightly confined
But that is no reason I shall alter my mind,
I might have had a man and a man of high degree
But I always will prove kind to the man that loves me
Then I was forced to the army to go
To see whether I could forget my love or no;
But when I got in sight with my armor shining bright
It made me think of Molly, my heart’s delight
Then seven long years I served one old king
At the end of seven years I returned home again
With my heart so full of grief and my eyes so full of tears
Oh how happy I’d a-been to got sight of my dear
O then I was forced to her father’s to go
To see whether my true love had remained, yes or no
The old woman saw me come, she wrung her hands and cried
Said,” Sir, my daughter loved you, and for your sake she died”
O then I was struck like a man that was slain
The tears from my eyes fell like showers of rain,
My grief, my grief, it is more than I can bear

   And I’ll pick a cheatham county chittlin’ cooker

There’s an art in chittlin’ cookin’ and all good chittlin cooks
They must master it by practice cause it ain’t reknowned in books
In the hills of cheatham county in sunny Tennessee
When chittlin’s are in season is where I long to be
Of all good things put be for me
I think chittlin’s are the best
And when I press that dying pillow
Let chittlin’s by my last request

Back up in the mountains in that old home town of mine
There’s not a brighter time of year than that of Christmas time
The bells in the little churchthey all begin to chime
Telling all for miles around Rejoice! It’s Christmas time!
Christmas bells are ringing I hear the times so sweet
The carolers are singing; I hear them in the street
Outside the white snow falling inside my heart I find
A world of joy and peace on earth back home at Christmas time
A candle in each window; they give a golden glow
While out among the shimmering pines lights sparkle in the snow
And through the lonely mountaintops the wind’s shrill echoes cry
For peace on earth good will toward men and faith that will not die
High above our little town so bright to be so far
There shines upon the whole wide world His gift our guiding star
Everyone in each home can feel a peace sublime
And know the joy the Yuletide brings to all at Christmastime

Tall pines are humming Christmas time is coming.
 Can’t you hear them bells ringin’ ringin’ joy to all here them singin’
Let it snow and I’ll be going back to my country home
Christmas times a’ coming Christmas times a’ coming
Christmas times a’ coming and I know I’m going home.
Holly’s in the window home where the wind blows
Can’t walk for running Christmas time is coming.
Home fires burning my heart’s yearning
For the folks at home when Christmas time is coming.

There’s a church in the valley by the wildwood
No lovelier place in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dell
   Oh, come to the church by the wildwood
   Oh, come to the church in the dale
   No spot is so dear to my childhood
   As the little brown church in the dell
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To list to the clear ringing bell
It’s tones so sweetly are calling
Oh, come to the church in the dell
There, close by the church in the valley
Lies one that I love so well
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath the willow
Disturb not her rest in the dell
There, close by the side of that loved one
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom
When the farewell hymn shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tomb

Lord I been hangin’ out of town in that low down rain
Watchin’ good time Charlie friend is drivin’ me insane
Down on shady Charlotte Street the green lights look red
Wish I was back home on the farm in my feather bed.
   Get myself a rockin’ chair
   To see if I can lose
   Them thin dime hard times
   Hell on Church Street blues.
Found myself a picker friend who’s read yesterday’s news
Folded up page twenty-one and stuck it in my shoe
Gave a nickle to the poor my good turn for the day
Folded up my own little folder threw it far away.
Lord I wish I had some guitar strings Old Black Diamond brand
I’d string up this old Martin box and go and join some band
But I guess I’ll just stay right here just pick and sing a while
Try to make me a little change and give them folks a smile.

You ought to see my Cindy she lives way down south
She’s so sweet the honey bees swarm around her mouth
 Get along home Cindy Cindy
Get along home Cindy Cindy
Get along home Cindy Cindy
I’ll marry you some day
The first I seen my Cindy she was standing in the door
Her shoes and stocking in her hand her feet all over the floor
She took me to her parlor she cooled me with her fan
She said I was the prettiest thing in the shape of mortal man
She kissed me and she hugged me she called me suger plum
She throwed her arms around me I thought my time had come
Oh Cindy is a pretty girl Cindy is a peach
She threw her arms around my neck and hung on like a leech
And if I was a sugar tree standing in the town
Each time my Cindy passed I’d shake some sugar down
And if had a needle and thread fine as I could sew
I’d sew that gal to my coat tails and down the road I’d go
I wish I was an apple a-hanging on a tree
Every time that Cindy passed she’d take a bite of me

A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky-tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of sherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that’s gay and bright
But it’s just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
But God who put the stars above I don’t believe made those lights
For it’s just a place for men to cry when things don’t turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights

The ones that have crossed the great chilling tide

And Jesus will lay your burdens aside
    A beautiful light will guide me to heaven

    It’s circle complete we’ll have a reunion

Do all in his power to guide you his way
Don’t let temptation guide your poor soul

   Climbing up the mountain to the sky
Moses freed his people from the pharaoh’s hand
Forty years they wandered through the desert sand
Led them out of Egypt to the promised land
And then he climbed on up to the mountain to the sky
Martin helped his people in a powerful fight
Led them in the struggle for the civil rights
Birmingham to Selma leading black and white
And then he climbed on up to the mountain to the sky

Doesn’t take more courage than is granted you
Eye upon the prize and you can see it through
And then you’ll climb up on the mountain too

Years have passed you’ve not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you’ll be close by

The tears from you I tried to hide

Take your tears to someone elses eyes
They’re made of glass and they cut like wounding lies

So close the door lightly when you go.
   Who was the one who wasted time
   Who was the one who stole my mind
   Who was the one who made me feel unkind

And find a life if the path is dark and cold

Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put those rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn’t have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewin’ every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
When she sewed she told a story from the Bible she had read
‘Bout a coat of many colors Joseph wore again
she said Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn’t wait to wear it Mama blessed it with a kiss
   A coat of many colors that my mama made for me
   Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
   I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
   With my coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Now with patches in my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughin’ and makin’ fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
Now I did not understand it for I felt almost rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
Then I told them all the stories mama told me while she sewed
How my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They did not understand it though I tried to make them see
That one is only poor if they choose to be
I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

It’s an old familiar story of a boy and a girl
And a love that went wrong from the start
How Bobby he loved Mary and she thought she love’d him
But she found she had a cold cheater’s heart
And that life out on the farm Ain’t what she had in mind
When she promised to honor and obey
So she took to runnin’ ’round all over town
Ain’t it funny how life turns out that way
The years have tumbled by Bobby turned an ol’ blind eye
To the things he hoped just weren’t true
And then came that fateful day when he had been away
Oh they say he came home just too soon
He found them lyin’ there oh it was more than he could bear
He found a gun she cried don’t be rash
But two shots filled the air he stood right there and stared
The deed was done it was over in a flash
That old judge looked down and sighed he said Bobby you’ll have to die
The law is clear and it must take it’s toll
Think on the deed you’ve done your race on earth is run
And may God have mercy on your soul
On a cold November morn in a prison so forelorn
The warden prayed as did the parson too
And the crowd gathered there they heard him loud and clear
His final words were Mary I love you
It’s an old familiar story of a boy and a girl
And a love that went wrong from the start
How Bobby he loved Mary and she thought she love’d him
But she found she had a cold cheater’s heart

Yet you’re afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A mem’ry from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn’t do
In angerunkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
You’ll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you’re afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain’t smart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Since I sailed from old Ireland and home
But those hills lush and green were a part of my dreams
When I dreamed of my Colleen Malone
On the day I returned to my sorrow I learned
That the angels had called her away
To a grave on a hill overlooking the mill
That’s the place where she’s sleeping today
   As the soft breezes blow through the meadow I go
   Past the mill with the moss covered stone
   Up the pathway I climb through the woods and the vines
   To be with my Colleen Malone
She was faithful each day as I sailed far away
There was no one but me that she loved
I remember those eyes soft and blue as the skies
And her heart was as pure as a dove
All the years of my life I will not take a wife
I will live in this valley above
Planting flowers around in this soft gentle ground
That is holding my Colleen Malone

And you can’t blame me now for walking out on you

He was just a lonely cowboy
With a heart so brave and true
He learned to love a maiden
With eyes of heaven’s own blue
They learned to love each other
And named their wedding day
When a quarrel came between them
And Jack he rode away
He joined a band of cowboys
An tried to forget her name
But out on the lonely prairie
She waits for him the same
One night when work was finished
Just at the close of day
Someone said sing a song Jack
Twill drive those cares away
When he reached the prairie
He found a new made mound
His friends they sadly told him
They’d laid his loved one down
They said as she was dying
She breathed her sweetheart’s name
And asked them with her last breath
To tell him when he came
Your sweetheart waits for you Jack
Your sweetheart waits for you
Out on the lonely prairie
Where the skies are always blue

One beautiful night when the moon was full
And the air was crisp and clear
A cowboy lay on the star lit plain
And thought of his home so dear
He thought of his mother he loved so well
And his slumber of sleep was blurred
Not a sound to be heard but throws of the night
As he sang a wild song to his herd
The cattle are lying so quite and still
On a carpet that mantles the west ?
While the golden lanes from the sky of night
Sing peace to the cowboys stress ?
Still he thinks of his mother in a far away land
And his thoughts by his memory was stirred
And he steals himself the old home again
As he sang a wild song to his herd
He’s far from the din of the city noise
Where the lanes of folly do shine
He’s far from the jaws of the dies sin ?
And the flow of sparkling wine
He’s in the great west with its mantle of green
Where his neighbors say never a word
A land of marriage of mountains and plains
Where a cowboy sings low to his herd

Packin’ all the crawdads he can pack

What you gonna do when the crawdads die honey

Sit on the bank until I cry

There ain’t no crawdads in this lake

And hold to the promises you made
How can it feel so right and then go so wrong

As she walked into that crossroads bar
Well I walked inside and sat me down
Ordered sweet red wine and I drank it down
She came and set beside me there
With a dark brown eyes and the red, red hair
I told her that I loved her true
Anything you want I’ll surely do
Said a man like you don’t get too far
With a girl like me at the crossroads bar
I like smoky light and a lonesome song
And I won’t do right if I can do wrong
You want the moon to burn behind the darkest star
And you won’t find love at the crossroads bar

Keep your love at home with your lovely wife

One morning in Jerusalem about the break of dawn
A great trial was in session, they tried our blessed lord
They scorned him and they mocked him, they made him carry the cross
On top of Calvary mountain, they crucified my Lord
   Oh the cry (Jesus cried) from the cross
   Forgive him blessed father, he died upon the cross
   Oh the cry (Jesus cried) from the cross
   The son of God was dying, to save the world from loss
Saint Peter he denied him at that awful trial at night
He said he never new him, it was an awful sight
He looked upon Saint Peter with eyes of perfect love
Saint Peter’s heart was broken, he prayed to God above
Crying father it is finished then he bowed his head and died
The world was left in darkness, the graves were open wide
An earthquake shook Jerusalem the dead walked into town
The multitudes were frightened, God’s wrath came pouring down

Far away in a Spanish dungeon
A Cuban soldier lay
Slowly dying from the torture
Inflicted day by day
He begged to send a message
But this kindness was denied
So he called his comrades to him
And told his story ere he died
   When Cubie gains her freedom
   And the Spaniards cease to reign
   There’s a loved one on that island
   I will never see again
   Oh find her for me comrades
   And tell her you were by my side
   And I bid you take this message
   To a soldiers promised bride
Tis the same old story comrades

When Cubie was struggling for her freedom
I was ordered to my gun
Though I’m a captain dying
The struggle will soon be o’er
Tell her I said to meet me
Where the soldiers fight no more

Oh listen today and a story I’ll tell,
In sadness and tear rimmed eyes,
Of a dreadful cyclone that came this way,
And blew our schoolhouse away
: Rye Cove (Rye Cove), Rye Cove (Rye Cove),
The land of my childhood and home,
Where life’s early morn I once loved to roam,
But now it’s so silent and lone
When the cyclone appeared it darkened the air,
And the lightning flashed over the sky,
And the children all cried, don’t take us away,
But spare us to go back home
There were mothers so dear and fathers the same,
That came to this terrible scene,
Searching and crying each found their own child,
Dying on a pillow of stone
Oh give us a home far beyond the blue sky,
Where storms and cyclones are unknown,
And there by life’s strand we’ll clasp the glad hand,
Our children in their heavenly home

In a pawn shop in Odysessa in the fall of ’64
The pawn shop man was leavin’ he was lockin’ up the door
I ran up just in time and I holler’d just through the screen
Hey, man, you got any good guitars in here,
he said “I got this D-18”
So I gave him a hundred dollars and I took that sucker home
I cleaned it up and strung it hit a chord and heard that tone
It was crisp and clean rich and full all a guitar ought to be
I said Thank you, Mr, Martin, you made this D-18 for me
   Said Thank you, Mr. Martin, I’m alright
   ‘Cause once again this old guitar helped me through the night
   I’m mighty grateful to you, you know how to make ’em right
   I said Thank you, Mr. Martin, I’m alright
If I’m feelin’ down and worthless and I haven’t got a dime
Wonderin’ if I spent my life just wastin’ my time
I pick up that old guitar some paper and a pen
I say Thank you, Mr. Martin, you saved my life again.
I’ve written songs about my lovers my family and my friends
My wife my child the old home place and the road that never ends
Heros hobos rock n’ roll and a honky tonk queen
I wrote ’em all without exception on my Martin D-18
Now It was made way back In ’43 when I was just a kid
I believe it’s about the best thing Mr. Martin ever did
It plays real good stays in tune and never treats me mean
Thank God for Mr. Martin and that fine old D-18.
Well there’s your Galagher your Gibson your Goya Gretch and Guild
I’ve played every kind of guitar that them guitar makers build
I’ picked on a lot of axes but the best I’ve ever seen
Is my funky beat up wonderful old Martin D-18.

My pocket book was empty
My heart was full of pain
Ten thousand miles away from home
Bumming the railroad train
It was standing on the platform
Smoking a cheep cigar
listening for that next freight train
To carry an empty car
Well I got off at Danville
Got stuck on the Danville girl
You bet your life she’s out of sight
She wore those Danville curls
She took me in her Kitchen
She treated me nice and kind
She got me in the notion
Of bumming all the time
She wore her hair on the back of her head
Like high-tone people do
But the very next train come down the line
I bid that girl adieu
I pulled my cap down over my eyes
Walked down to the track
Then I caught a westbound freight
Never did look back

Where the Walker runs down to the Carson Valley plain,
There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and fair was she
And the sweetest flower that bloomed o’er the range.
Her voice was sweet as the sugar candy
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down.
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
That shine in the night out of Yerrington town.
She was courted by young Vandermeer
And quite handsome was he I am to hear
He brought her silver rings and lacy things
And she promised to wed before the snows fell that year.
But her pony did stumble and she did fall.
Her dyin’ touched on the heart of us all.
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet to his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall.
They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too.
At dusty Sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true.

Reign and triumph in your breast

Gazing on the shining bands
Wondering at their costly garments
And the laurels in their hands
There upon the golden pavement
See the ransomes marched along
While the splendid courts of glory
Sweetly echo in with their song

And the flock they’ve led below
Here with joy they dwell together

And seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mines

Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope or a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines

There’s a low, green, valley on the old Kentucky shore
Where I’ve whiled many happy hours away,
Just a sitting and a singing by the little cottage door
Where lived my darling Nellie Gray 
When the moon had climbed the mountain, and the stars were shining too
Then I’d take my darling Nellie Gray
And we’d go floatin down the river in my little red canoe
While my banjo sweetly I would play 
One night I went to see her, but she’s gone the neighbors say
And the white man had bound her with his chain
They have taken her to Georgia for to wear her life away
As she toils in the cotton and the cane 
   Oh, my poor Nellie Gray, they have taken you away
   And I’ll never see my darling, anymore
   I’m sitting by the river and a weeping all the day
   For you’ve gone from the old Kentucky shore 
Now my canoe is under water, and my banjo is unstrung

While I stay on the old Kentucky shore 
Now I’m getting old and feeble, and I cannot see my way
I can hear someone knocking on my door
I can hear the angels singing, and I see my Nellie Gray
So farewell to the old Kentucky shore 
   Oh, my darling Nellie Gray, up in heaven, so they say

The break of dawn and the hills of home
You’re my little darlin’ brown eyes
I’ve come back darlin’ brown eyes
I’ve come back darlin’ don’t cry
Back to stay never to stray
You’re my little darlin’ brown eyes

Wake up wake up darling Corey
What makes you sleep so sound
The revenue officers are coming
They’re gonna tear your still-house down.
Well the first time I seen darling Corey
She was sitting by the banks of the sea
Had a forty-four around her body
And a five-string on her knee.
Go away go away darling Corey
Quit hanging around my bed
Your liquor has ruined my body
Pretty women gone to my head.
Dig a hole dig a hole in the meadow
Dig a hole in the cold damp ground
Dig a hole dig a hole in the meadow
We’re gonna lay darling Corey down.
Can’t you hear them bluebirds a-singing
Don’t you hear that mournful sound
They’re preaching darling Corey’s funeral
In some lonesome graveyard ground.

When first I met my darling daisies
Down by the garden wall
I was walking along the street so shady
I was going for a twilight call
   I love to sing and dance among the roses
   Down by the garden wall
   Tis there I’d like to meet my daisies
   When I make a twilight call
She was sleeping in a bed of roses
Dreaming of the by and by
While the little birds around were singing
Up above the branches so high
If you want to see a bright eyed beauty
Bright as the stars that shine
Just come and go with me some evening
To see this pretty girl of mine

The moon still way up high
Though soon enough the sun would warm the colors of the sky
I lay awake I could not sleep or even close my eyes
And dear you seemed so restless too I should have realized
The house was dark the moonlight was inviting and so strange
I went out by the window to watch the morning change
And just before the break of dawn and bird began to sing
And somehow then it came to me just what the day would bring
   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   I know you tried to make me see and no I never would
   Too late that dawn the day you left I finally understood
A stray old cat did walk the fence outside my window bed
He stopped and looked my way and then he went without a care
And I wondered when he’d ramble back or why he ever should
But I knew that he was just like you and that he never would
   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   Those words you spoke now ring so true just like you said they would

Indeed I thought his love my own
Until a dark eyed girl betrayed me
And then he cares no more for me
Just go and leave me if you wish to
It will never trouble me
For in your heart you love another
And in my grave I’d rather be
Last night you were sweetly sleeping
Dreaming in some sweet repose
While I, a poor girl, broken hearted
Listened to the wind that blows
When I see your babe a laughing
It makes me think of your sweet face
But when I see your babe a crying
It makes me think of my disgrace

   How I long for your sweet face and sunny smile
   I would give up all I own just to be with you at home
   And to linger there for just a little while
Oh, the morning glory vine around the cabin door would twine
And the mockingbird would sing along the tree
Then we’d take our dear old book and go down beside the brook
And there for hours she’d sit and read to me
Now I’m in this world alone, the old folks are not at home
They’ve gone up to a happier home above

As we stand by the mystical stream
In the valley and by the dark river of death
And yet ’tis no more than a dream 
   Only a dream, only a dream
   Of glory beyond the dark stream
   How peaceful the slumber, how happy the waking
   Where death is only a dream 
Why should we weep when the weary ones rest
In the bosom of Jesus supreme
In the mansions of glory prepared for the blessed
For death is no more than a dream 
Naught in the river the Saints should appall
Though’ it frightfully dismal may seem
In the arms of our Savior no ill can befall
They find it no more than a dream 
Over the turbid and onrushing tide
Doth the light of eternity gleam
And the ransomed the darkness and storm shall out ride
To wake with glad smiles from their dream

Is he sleeping peacefully?
The wind from the north is blowing icy cold
Please keep him warm for me
   What does the deep sea say

   It moans, it groans, it flashes and it foams
   And rolls on its weary way
I stand on the beach alone
And gaze at the misty blue
Deep sea as you hold him to your breast
Does he mention my name to you
If only my dreaming soul
Some token of love could find
If only a wave would show my where he sleeps
Then I’d leave this world behind
A beautiful rose one day
I placed on the crest of a wave
Deep sea take it please
And lay it so it falls above his watery grave
The driftwood I watched in vain
My rose never came back again
Deep sea take another message to my love
Saying I’ll meet him above

Now a woman like that all she does is hate you
She doesn’t know what makes a man a man
She’ll talk about the times that she’s been with you
She’ll speak your name with everyone she can.
Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her soul is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her up to see a person crying
She’s just the kind that you can live without
Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
Well it’s all right to call her but I’ll bet you
The moon is full and you’re just wasting time.

Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we gave the show 
I met a little salvation band
Singing with all its might
I gave my heart to Jesus
And left the show that night 
   The day will soon be over
   And begging will be done
   And no more gems be gathered
   So let us all press on 
   Till Jesus comes to claim us
   And says it is enough
   The diamonds will be shining
   No longer in the rough 
While reading through the Bible
Some wondrous sights I see
I read of Peter, James and John
By the Sea of Galilee 
And Jesus when he found them
He found them very tough
and they were precious diamonds
He gathered in the rough

T’was the place where I was born on a bright October morn
And it’s nestled at the end of my river of memories
Did you ever go sailing down the river of memories
To the little log cabin that’s nestled among the sycamore trees
Where the sunshine is cheery and nothing in the world grows dreary
That’s my cabin at the end of my river of memories
There’s a mother old and gray at the end of memory’s way
I’ll meet her there tonight among the trees
With a smiling welcome she so sweetly beckons me
To the cabin at the end of my river of memories
When the twilight shadows fall many childhood voices call
Back again to the days that used to be
And in answer to their prayer I will soon be sailing there
To the cabin at the end of my river of memories

He never worked down at the saw mill
he couldn’t stand that hot sunshine
He had twenty-one years of real life
he lived a thousand in that time
One night when the blues had got him
he must have drank three fifths of rum
He got mean as hell when I told him
he’d never live past twenty-one
Well if a man ever hit me harder
well I don’t know where or when
He picked me up off that old bar floor
he said I’d like to be your friend
One night I heard him talkin’
to an old man at the bar
He said Dad, you know I love you,
I just don’t like where you are
Tell Mama to turn my light on,
turn down my feather bed
I’ll be twenty-one tomorrow
but tomorrow he was dead.
It was twenty-one miles to the graveyard
twenty-one roses red
Told the story of the rounder
who at twenty-one he was dead
He drank whiskey for his liver
smoked cigarettes for his lungs
He loved women for his ego

Someday our romance may break up just by chance
But don’t blame it all on me
You just can’t go on with no smile in your heart
Don’t blame it all on me
Our friends they all say that we too soon must part
Don’t blame it all on me
Now if you’ll change dear I will change too
And maybe then we’ll find love anew
Someday with the dawn all our love may be gone
But don’t blame it all on me

Don’t tell me your lies if I should leave you
Don’t pull at your hair it won’t help at all
You did it before and fooled my heart dear
Now you might as well talk to the wall

But if you’re gonna cheat on me don’t cheat in our home town.
 How can I stand up to my friends and look em’ in the eye
Admit the questions that I know would be nothin’ but lies
You spend all your pastime makin’ me a clown
But if you’re gonna cheat on me don’t cheat in our home town.
Now there are no secrets in this little country town
Every one knows every one for miles and miles around
Your bright eyes and your sweet smile are drivin’ me insane
You think it’s smart to break my heart and run down my name.

On my kayoose let me straddle my old saddle

I have a mind for rambling so far away from home
It was on one moonlight evening the stars were shinning bright
And with an ugly dagger I made the spirits fly
Twas then the sobber struck me as plain as you can see
I’m doomed I’m ruined forever throughout eternity
I courted a fair young lady her name I will not tell
Oh why should I disgrace her when I am doomed for hell
But now upon my scaffold my time’s not very long

Once it was the brightest red
It’s withering fast its head is bowing
And no kind words to it are said
 
Please don’t neglect the rose in your garden
Show it your love every day
Then it will bloom for you in all its beauty
And it will not fade away
 
I guess by now you know my story
Don’t neglect a love that’s true
For it may prove to be the sweetest flower
That will ever bloom for you

A husband wife or little child
Or it may be your own true lover
That you’ve neglected all the while

and it almost breaks my heart
Tell me darling will you love me
when we meet no more to part
Or will this parting be forever

When our hearts will be united
and all sorrows pass away

And her little freckled nose
And her golden hair hanging down her back
Tied with a big blue ribbon bow

I loved her with all my heart and soul
But she married another without a thought or care
And she left me in this world alone and cold

Of that weeping willow tree
And when I die I want you to bury me

Got my education out behind a barn
Left one Sunday morning in a driving rain

Oh, engineer, let your whistle whine
Oh, get me out of here, a little further down the line
I’ve been to California and I’ve been to New Orleans
Been to New York City and everywhere between
I’ve eat beans and taters your finest caviar
Drank brandy from a snifter and moonshine from a jar
Spent a year in prison with a number for my name
Fed me bread and water tied to a ball and chain
I swore the day they slammed the door and the jailer locked me in
If they ever let me out of here I’ll never go back again
Been dreaming of the day when I return back to my home
its where I want to settle down never more to roam
Sit me on a tractor and point me to the fields,
I will plow the furrows my hands upon the wheel

Now down the road just a mile or two
Lives a little girl named Pearly Blue
About so high and her hair is brown
The Prettiest thing boys in this town
Now anytime you want to know
Where I’m going, down the road
Get my girl on the line
You’ll find me there most any old time
Now everyday and Sunday too
I go to see my Pearly Blue
Before you hear that rooster crow
You’ll see me headed down the road
Now old man Flatt he owned the farm
From the hog lot to the barn
From the barn to the rail
He made his living by carrying the mail
Now every time I get the blues
I walk the soles right off my shoes
I don’t know why I love her so
That gal of mine lives down the road

This might be our last goodbye
Our country calls you to defend a great land
So do your part just like a man
   Down where the river bends
   With god’s help we’ll meet again
   Under the same old sycamore tree
   Proud of each other and the land of the free
I go down to the ocean blue
Its just as close as I came to you
This old ocean might keep us apart
But it won’t keep you dear out of my heart
If the worst should happen and the poppies should wave
Over your far distant, lonely grave
All the rest of my life I’ll spend in prayer
I’ll meet you in heaven there’ll be no war there

When he heard his little child scream
He went to the side of the little child’s bed
She said daddy I’ve had such a dream
   Oh daddy don’t go to the mines today
   For dreams have so often come true
   Oh daddy oh daddy please don’t go away
   For I never could live without you
I dreamed that the mines were all flaming with fire
And the miners all fought for their lives
Just then the scene changed and the mouth of the mine
Was covered with sweethearts and wives
Go down to the village and tell all your friends
That as sure as the bright sun does shine
There’s something a going to happen there today
Oh daddy don’t go to the mine

All I got to do is picture you and I can feel you in my heart
   So dream of me everytime you get to feelin’ blue
   Dream of me and I’ll be dreaming of you
I’ve been a lot of places but there’s just no place like home
And I’m always on my way back to you every minute that I’m gone

Close your eyes and think of me you can feel me in your heart

In dreams of yesterday I wandered
Back to my little cabin door.
I strolled beside an old rock garden
And saw familiar scenes once more.
I heard the organ softly playing
Its music came so sweet and low.
And I heard my mother sweetly singing
As oft I did so long ago.
   I was dreaming of a little cabin
   And I heard somebody call my name.
   I Looked and saw a sweet old lady
   And it seemed I was a child again.
   She gently put her arms around me
   And kissed her little boy once more.
   I knew it was the same sweet mother
   That had kissed me many times before
I heard her sing the “Rock of Ages”
And “Silver Threads Among the Gold”.
She told me once again of Jesus
Within that little cabin fold.
She opened up her faded Bible
Where the family records used to be
And I knew it was the same sweet mother
That years ago had cradled me.
An orphan through this world I wander
Since mother left the old homestead.
No one to pray for me at twilight
No place to lay my weary head.
I miss her voice so gently calling
I miss her precious guiding hand.
But I know that when I reach God’s city
I’ll hear her call my name again.

   Love, love that I can’t hide
   These dreams are breakin’ down all my pride
While music played he danced and held you oh so tight
The same way we did when our love was young and bright
Then he kissed you under lights that were so dim
I couldn’t stand to see you there alone with him
I realize a dream is only fantasy
But tell me why these dreams seem so real to me
Every night I have this same old misery
I guess it’s just because of all my jealousy

For the dust was covered o’er it not a finger print was plain
   Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
   The words of all our prophets and the sayings of our Lord
   Of all the other books you’ll find there’s none salvation holds
   Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor your soul
You can read your magazines read of love and tragfic things
But not one word of Bible verse not a scripture do you know
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
But if dust is covered o’er it it is sure to doom your soul
If you have a friend you’d like to help along life’s way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible crade the wrong way for the right

Tell my mother God assist her

When his lips grew pale and cold
Listen brother catch each whisper

Hold them as when last I held them
Held them closely to my breast

In a low humble cottage a poor mother lay
Although wracked with pain as she lay there contented
With her Savior, her Friend and peace with Him made

   The books will be open, the roll will be called
   Oh how sad it will be if forever we’re parted
   While some rise to Glory while others stand the Fall
Oh that mother of yours has gone o’er the river
And you promised you’d meet her while knelt by her bed
As the death sweat rolled off and fell down on her pillow
Oh, her mem’ry still lives although she is dead
You remember the kiss and the last words she uttered
Oh the arms that embraced you are with you no more
As you stand by her grave teardrops fall on her casket
And you vowed there to meet her on that happy shore

And these were the dying words he said

   Let this be my last repose
   Lay my feet beneath while I lie
   Lay my head beneath the rose
Take this message to my mother for I know she’s old and gray
At home I know she’s waiting for her boy’s return some day
Oh my mother I’ve come through for my country and for you
And I’m dying for the red white and blue

There’s a little girl waiting there for me
Tell her that the rose she gave me will be placed upon my grave

There I courted a fair young maiden

And her cheeks were rosy red
On her breast she wore a lilly
Where I longed to lay my head

If you my bride might ever be
If she says no, come back and tell me
And I’ll run away with thee
No I’ll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best
The ocean’s deep and I can’t wade it
And I have no wings to fly
I’ll just get some blue-eyed boatman
For to row me o’er the tide
I’ll go back to East Virginia

Leave old North Carolina alone

I’m tired of eating out of your hand I’m tired of getting told
These blues are leaving me as of now I’l1 be the one so bold
You better walk the chalk line and let this poor man be
Or else you’ll find yourself alone footloose and fancy free.
When I come home you’re waiting to question what I’ve done
You have my free time planned for me I work from sun to sun
If only you would realize that old stuff gets old
A man likes just a little time that he can call his own.
You’re oh so domineering your wish is my command
Your jealous heart won’t let me live you boss me and demand
New clothes a diamond ring so fine a Cadillac is grand
On payday I’m your victim and I’m eating out of your hand.

I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three 
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
His face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see
And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee

Moonlight shinning over Dixie
To my heart will ever bring
Dreams of snowy fields of cotton
Everywhere the darkies sing
   In the evening in the moonlight
   In dear old Tennessee
   And the evening bells are ringing
   Across the hills so tenderly
Moonlight makes me sigh for you dear
Makes me long to hold your hand
I know I’m missing hugs and kisses
Far away from Dixieland
My darling come come I am waiting
Come let me hold you very near
We’ll build a bower among the flowers
Growing down in Dixieland

I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place the casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train
The baby’s eyes were red from weepin
His little heart is filled with pain
Oh dad he cried they’re takin mama
Away from us on the evening train
I turned to walk away from the depot
It seems I heard here call my name
Take care of baby and tell him daring
That I’m goin home on the evening train
I pray that god will give me courage
To carry on til we meet again
It’s hard to know she’s gone forever
They’re carryin her home on the evening train

Look at the sky baby what do you see?
Looks like the tears that I’ve cried
Falling down like rain on the ground
Every time you say good-bye.
Take a look around now why don’t you feel
The way the cold wind stings and blinds
And each time we part like arrows through your heart
Every time you say good-bye.
   There’s a restless feeling knocking at my door today
   There’s a shadow hanging ’round my garden gate
   I read between the lines of words you can’t disguise
   Love has gone away and put these tears in my eyes.
Look at the sky baby see how it cries
Ain’t it just like my tears
Falling down like rain on the ground
Every time you say good-bye.

Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Lord I wanna go to heavenbut I don’t wanna die
I long for the day that I’ll have a new birth ‘stead of grievin’ here on earth
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.
Once upon a time there was a man his name was Heas-i-kie
He walked with God both day and night but he didn’t want to die
He cried Oh Lord, please let me live, oh, mend these broken bones
God smiled down on Heasikie and gave him fifteen years to go.
When Jesus walked upon this earth he knew his father’s friends
He knew that he must give his life to save the soul of man
When Judas had betrayed him his father heard his cry
He was brave enough unto his death but he didn’t want to die.

I am a face lost in the crowd
A defeated man no one cares about
For the dreams I’ve had are gone somehow
I’m just a face lost in the crowd
All hopes of wealth and fame are gone
And darkness looms where the sun once shone
No light is there the fire’s burned out
And I’m just a face lost in the crowd
The tears I’ve shed now blur my eyes
The friends I’ve known would not recognize
This broken man with no way out

My brave boy sleeps in his faded coat of blue
In a lonely grave unknown lies a heart that beats so true
He sank faint and hungry among the famished brave
And they laid him sad and lonely within a nameless grave
   No more the bugle calls oh weary one
   Rest noble spirits in their graves unknown
   For we’ll find you and know you among the good and true
   Where a robe of white is given for a faded coat of blue
He cried “Give me water and just a little crumb
And my mother she will bless you through all the years to come
And tell my sweet sister so gentle good and true
That I’ll meet her up in Heaven in my faded coat of blue”
No dear one was nigh him to close his mild blue eyes
No gentle voice was by him to give him sweet replies
No stone marks the lonely sod on a lad so brave and true
In a lonely grave he’s sleeping in his faded coat of blue

The flowers I saw in the wildwood
Have since dropped their beautiful leaves
And the many dear friends of my childhood
Have slumbered many years in their graves
But the bloom of the flowers I remember
Though their smiles I may never more see
For the cold chilly winds of December
Stole my flowers’ companions from me
   It’s no wonder that I’m broken hearted
   And stricken with sorrow should be
   For we have met we have loved we have parted
   My flowers companions and me
How dark looks this world and how dreary
When we part from the ones that we love
There is rest for the faint and the weary
And friends to meet with loved ones above
For in heaven I can but remember
When from earth my soul shall be free
There no cold chilly winds of December
Shall steal my companions from me

I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you

As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said good-bye

Take warning how you court your men
They’re like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they’re gone
They’ll tell to you some loving story
And they’ll make you think that they love you well
And away they’ll go and court some other
And leave you there in grief to dwell
I wish I was on some tall mountain
Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
I’d write a letter to my false true lover
Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings to fly so high
I’d fly to the arms of my false true lover
And when he’d ask, I would deny
Oh love is handsome, love is charming
And love is pretty while it’s new
But love grows cold as love grows older
And fades away like morning dew

They are scattered like the leaves upon the ground.
Some folks drift along through life and never thrill
To the feeling that a good deed brings until
It’s too late and they are ready to lie down
Beneath the leaves there scattered on the ground.
Lord let my eyes see every need of every man;
Let me stop and always lend a helping hand
Then when I’m laid beneath that mossy ground
There’ll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground.
To your grave there’s no use taking any gold;
It’s no use when it’s time for hands to fold.
When you leave this world for a better home some day
The only thing you’ll take is what you gave away.

That valley was closer to heaven
Than any place this poor fool has been

Twas on one Saturday evening
About the hour of ten
In a little mining town
Where trouble did begin
Everybody there were drinking
There were whiskey everywhere
Dewey Lee got to thinking
He had no business there
He was so tall and handsome
His heart so true and brave
Joe Jenkins pulled his pistol
And sent him to his grave
He took the life of Dewey
When life had just began
And Dewey went to Heaven
While Joe went to the pen
He took the life of Dewey
Because he would not tell
We know he murdered Dewey
For Dewey’s pistol fell
His mother sits now weepin’
She weeps and mourns all day
She prays to meet her boy
In a better world some day
So hearken to my story
And what I have to say
Get right with your Maker
We’ll meet Him again some day
The clerk said, “Stand up, boy
And listen to your crime!”
They sent him down to Richmond
To serve out his time
Young men all take warning
For this you must outlive
Don’t take the life of anyone
For life you cannot give
You may possess great riches
Put many beneath the sod
But money won’t hire a lawyer
When you stand before your God

    He delivered us from sin and he’ll come this way again

He raised poor Lazarus up from the dead
Turned pure water into wine
And sent his only son to die

Not made by human hands
One hundred miles its gates are wide
Abundance entrance there
With fifty miles of elbow room
On either side to spare
   When the gates swing wide on the other side
   Just beyond the sunset sea
   There’ll be room to spare as we enter there
   Room for you and room for me
   For the gates are wide on the other side
   Where the flowers ever bloom
   On the right hand on the left hand
   Fifty miles of elbow room
Sometimes I’m cramped and crowded here
And long for elbow room
I want to reach for altitude
Where fair flowers bloom
It won’t be long til I shall pass
Into that city fair
With fifty miles of elbow room
On either side to spare

And to her questions these words replied

His pilgrimage over no longer to roam
And smiling he thinks of her shinning eyes
Shinning with welcoming glad surprise
A dandy letter he takes from his breast
To which his extended lips were pressed
And reading once more by the warming light
These words he had spoken to her that night
Once more he seeks the old garden gate
But he rides a land alas it’s too late

   I laid the tracks never rode the train
   Forty years of suffering forty years of pain
I had a wife and a little queen
I’ve had a son I’ve never seen
All I have left now it seems
Is a broken heart and broken dreams
Now I’m old, I’ve done my time
Ain’t nothin left but to sit and pine
Nobody here even knows my name
I have no one but myself to blame

Oh why did you leave me in this lonesome place
With four walls around me and a memory of your face
Why can’t I be happy why can’t I forget
With four walls around me I wish we’d never met
   With four walls around me it gets so lonesome dear
   Dreaming of you darling and wishing you were here
   Four walls around me my heart is full of pain
   Trying to forget you but it’s all in vain.
Oh someday you’ll be sorry you left me al1alone
With four walls around you you’ll remember how you done me wrong
Your time is coming and I know it won’t be long
You’ll have nothing there but four walls and a memory of this song

Yonder comes that Four-Twenty Special
Fastest train on the line
And when you hear that whistle a’ blowin’
You will know she’s right on time.
One night while a poolin’ down through Dixie
The fireman said “look ahead”
And the sight they saw made the blood run cold
North bound freighter straight ahead
I’ve worked on this railroad most of my life
And I guess I’ll work ’til I die
But I’ve never seen a train like the Four-Twenty Special
Her lonesome whistle made me want to cry

   She walks through the corn leading down to the river
   Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
   She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
   And left me to die like a fox on the run
   Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, on the run
Everybody knows, the reason for the fall
When woman tempted man down in paradise’s hall
This woman tempted me, and took me for a ride
Like the lonely fox, I need a place to hide
We’ll pour a glass of wine, to fortify our soul
We’ll talk about the world and friends we used to know
I see a string of girls, who’ll put me on the floor
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at my door

    Over you my Francis Lee

Frankie and Johnnie were lovers
Lordy how they did love
They swore to be true to each other
Just as true as the stars above
He was her man but he’s doing her wrong
Frankie she was a good woman
Just as every one knows
She gave her man a hundred dollars
Just to buy him a new suit of clothes
He was her man but he done her wrong
Johnnie went down to the corner
He asked for a glass of beer
Frankie went down in an hour or so
Said has my loving Johnnie been here
He’s my man but he’s doing me wrong
I ain’t gonna tell you no stories
I ain’t gonna tell you no lies
I saw your lovin’ Johnnie
Making love to Nellie Bligh
He’s your man but he’s doing you wrong
Frankie went home in a hurry
She didn’t go for fun
She hurried home to get a hold of
A big forty four gun
He’s her man but he’s doing her wrong
Roll me over darling
Roll me over slow
Roll me on my right side
Cause my left one hurts me so
He’s my man but he done me wrong

Got a women in San Antone

I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
The humming of the driver was my lullaby
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry
I got the freight train blues Lawdy Lawdy
Got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I gotta Oh Lawdy
Guess I’m never gonna lose the freight train blues
My daddy was a fireman and my mammy dear
Was the only daughter of the engineer
My sweetie is a brakeman and that ain’t no joke
It’s a shame the way she keeps a good man broke
Aeroplanes and autos always leave me cold
The moaning of a steamboat never stirs my soul
The only thing that makes me want to navigate
Is a wildcat whistle on a south bound freight
I know I’m old enough to quit this running round
I’ve tried a hundred times to stop and settle down
But every time I find a place I’d like to stay
I hear a freight train holler and I’m on my way

From a pick-up to a long limousine
Cotton to satin Birmingham to Manhatten
She had to follow her dream.
I saved up enough to buy her one small diamond
That’s the year our old tractor broke down
And the dream house I promised her still lies by the shade tree
Some old bricks and boards on the ground.
She begged me to take her to see New York City
So I mortgaged the farm and we were gone
While we were there she took up with a rich man
I came back to the country alone.
There is the garden where she touched every flower
There’s the meadow where we walked hand in hand
If only she’d waited she’d have more than she dreamed of
Because today they struck oil on my land.

The life our Saviour lived on earth is told
Found upon the pages of the Master’s book of truth
Every word so precious to my soul
From the manger to the cross rugged cross of Calvary
The road that Jesus walked for you and me all alone
By the world forsaken still He shed His blood for me
From the manger to the cross the rugged cross of Calvary
Amidst the stranger’ss cattle where the birth of Jesus came
The lonely manger kept Him from the cold
And there was the beginning of the journey Jesus made
Today it is the greatest story told
Many wonders were revealed while here on earth He dwelled
He healed the sick and made the blind to see
Five thousand were the numbers of the hungry who did feast
He blessed and multiplied the bread and meat
No earthly treasures did He own He sought no wealth or fame
Weary was the path He had to trod
Here He suffered many things for this world knew Him not
He died upon the cross the Son of God

   The rangers are searching for me
   I’m riding away from my home in Texas
   A fugitive ever to be
I had a good mother I had a good father
They handed a warning to me
The men that I ran with committed a murder
And laid the blame on me
Little Maggie my sweetheart I know she’s lonely
And longs for me to return
My happiness ended the night we parted
And now for her I yearn
How lonely how dreary with nothing to cheer me
My thoughts go stealing back home
My life of sadness will never know gladness

Squeezing a lady’s glove
Her lovely hand was in it
As I waltzed around so gay
I thought myself in paradise
It’s funny when you feel that way

   It’s funny when you feel that way
   I thought myself in paradise
   It’s funny when you feel that way
Again we met one afternoon
As we were all alone
I pumped up nerve to ask if she
Would one day be my own
She blushed and said go ask poppa
And ask him if I may
I danced a cantor around the room
It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   I danced a cantor around the room
   It’s funny when you feel that way
The old boy said that we might we
And so he crowned my bliss
I shall be a double man
In about a month from this
Though it seemed to me somehow the time
Will never pass away
For I long to hear the wedding bells
It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way

It was the year of 1900 that was 80 years ago
Death come’d a howling on the ocean and when death calls you’ve got to go
Galveston had a sea wall just to keep the water down
But a high tide from the ocean blew the water all over the town.
Wasn’t that a mighty storm
Wasn’t that a mighty storm in the morning
Wasn’t that a mighty storm
It blew all the people away.
The sea began to rolling the ships they could not land
I heard a captain crying Oh God save a drowning man
The rain it was a falling and the thunder began to roll
The lightning flashed like Hell-fire and the wind began to blow
The trees fell on the island and the houses gave away
Some they strived and drownded others died every way.
The trains at the station were loaded with the people all leaving town
But the trestle gave way with the water and the trains they went on down
Old death the cruel master when the winds began to blow
Rode in on a team of horses and cried death won’t you let me go.
The flood it took my mother it took my brother too
I thought I heard my father cry as I watched my mother go
Old death your hands are clammy when you’ve got them on my knee
You come and took my mother won’t you come back after me?

About three miles from the back town yard
The river curves on down
Not far south of the town depot
Sullivan’s shack was found
Up on the higher ground.
You could see him every day
Just walking down the line
With his old brown sack across his back
Long hair down behind
Speaking his worried mind.
   It’s a long way from the delta to the North Georgia hills
   A tote sack full of ginseng won’t pay my travelling bills
   I’m too old to ride the rails I’ll bum the road alone
   So I guess I’ll never make it back to home
   My muddy water Mississippi Delta home.
The winters here they get too cold
The damp it makes me ill
Can’t dig no roots on the mountain side
With the ground froze hard and still
Gotta stay at the foot of the hill.
But next summer
things turn right
The companies will pay high
I’ll make enough money to pay my bills
Bid these mountains goodbye

Well if you’re going in a snowflake storm
Where the rivers freeze and summers end
Will you see that she has a coat so warm
To protect her from the howling wind.
Please see for me if her hair hangs low
And flows in ringlets ’round her breasts
Please see for me if her hair hangs low

The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Geary and Pine
On her face there was beauty of nature
And her eyes just seemed to expand
Her hair was so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band
We strolled down the street together
In my pocket she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band
I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue velvet band
She left me to face all the trouble
With a diamond that was worth ten grand
They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I’m an innocent man
The guilty one now she lie’s dying
The girl in the blue velvet band
Last night when bed-time was ringin
Standing there close to the bars
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out in the ocean of stars
I’ll be out in a year and I’m leaving
But I’ll carry the name of a man
That served ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet band
And when I get out I’ll endeavor
To live in some other land
And I’ll bid farewell to old Frisco
And the girl in the blue velvet band

Didn’t even have the love of God within
But now I’ve found Him and I’m glad to say

God loves His children brother yes I know
He will protect you anywhere you go
Just call the point He will get you there
God will protect you brother anywhere
Brother take warning while yet you have time
Don’t let old Satan lead you on down the line
Just tell old Satan to stay out of your way

I’m going to follow Jesus everyday
Nothing can change me and I’m glad to say

Head up a moonshine still

And a card with your picture upon it

Tell me why that your smile is not bright
Tell me why you have grown so cold-hearted

But baby I’m switchin’ to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I’m tired of running on the same old track
Bought a one-way ticket and I won’t be back
This golden rocket’s gonna roll my blues away
Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That’s your cue and by now you know
That I got another true love a-waitin’ in Tennessee
This midnight special’s a-burnin’ the rail
So woman don’t try to follow my trail
This golden rocket’s a-rollin’ my blues away
That old conductor he seemed to know
That you done me wrong I was feelin’ low
For he yelled alound We’re over that Dixon line
The brakeman started singin’ a song
Said “You’re worried now but it won’t be long”
This golden rocket is leavin’ your blues behind
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl
Let’s rise and shine, good mornin’ ya all
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day
As I kissed my baby in the station door
That whistle blew like it never did before
Of the golden rocket that rolled my blues away

Looking through old memories in my cedar closet stashed away
I found the old mandolin Grandpa used to play
I picked it up and held it close thinking ’bout those years ago
And all the great music Grandpa made
Weathered worn but never frail with calloused hands he gently played
To bring an easy feeling to a hard working day
When times were tough as they could be he never once complained to me
He’d just let the music sooth the the pain
When Grandpa played the mandolin the family gathered ’round
To sing the old time songs generations handed down
I remember every single phrase from every song he played
Wish I could sing a song with Grandpa today
I recall 1961 the year Grandpa passed away
The family gathered ’round once more to sing Amazing Grace
Now this mandolin’s reminding me of what my Grandpa taught to me
That music makes the world a better place

There are heros they hide until forever
And I’m singin’ this song for one of them
He’s the man that you passed on the road there
The one with his life on the loose
Goin’ either somewhere or nowhere
Goin’ without me without you
For he is this world’s constant orphan
Travelin’ out his long time
Livin’ on apples from orchards
And dyin’ from grapes on the vine
You can find him in big city winters
Out where the mission bell crys
And sorrow echos through the suburbs
And tries to close all his eyes
And dream of his railroad existance
As if it were some kind of dream
As if the extent of the distance
Were what his heart would go him
You can find him in Pittsburg at Christmas
You can find him in Buffalo in June
And he knows all the back roads between them
Like a Gypsy he pulls a broom
And it’s route twenty-two all over again
Stake it well down and try to look like sombody’s friend
Look strong at the men smile for the girls
Puzzle at the rest of the world

I go back to the place where she’s sleeping

Just a few nights together to be

By her side though I know she is dead

   Grave on the green hillside grave on the green hillside
   In the years to come we will calmly sleep in a grave on the green hillside
And this land is full of these little graves in the valleys plains and hills
There’s angel too for each little grave an angel procession fills
I know not how but I sometimes think that they lead us with gentle hand
And a whisper falls on a willing ear from the shore of a far off land
And these little graves are but wayside marks that point to a far off land
And they speak to the soul of a better day of a day that’s near at hand
Though we first must walk through the chartless fields yet Christ will be our guide
We will reach the shore of a far off land through a grave on a green hillside

   Where we shall live and die never more
   Even the Lord will be in that number
   When we have reached that heavenly shore
Those who have strayed were sought by the master
He who once gave his life for the sheep
Out on the mountain still He is searching
Bringing them in forever to keep
We will not heed the voice of the stranger
For he would lead us on to despair
Following home with Jesus our savior
We shall all reach that country so fair

For a miner’s grave is all you’ll ever own
Cause of hard times everywhere
I can’t find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I’ve ever known. 
So I’ll move away into some crowded city
In some northern fact’ry town you’ll find me there
though I’ll leave the past behind
I’ll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I can bear 
But someday I’ll go back to West Virginia
To the green rolling hills I love so well

And at night row her around in the gum tree canoe
With my hand on my banjo and my toe on the oar
I would sing her a song to the river’s soft roar
While the bright stars shone down on my Julah so true
And they danced in her eyes in the gum tree canoe

That we couldn’t get back so we thought we’d just stay
We spied a tall ship with a flag of true blue
And she took us in tow in the gum tree canoe

The trees gave way to moonlight on the hills beyond my gaze
And my eyes caught sight of something there in the foggy midnight haze
The air was damp the night was cold and quiet deathly still
I climbed up through the grey moonlight and stood upon that hill
What I’d seen from down below before me now did lay
It was a handmade cross with stones around to mark a six foot grave
The cross was rough and made of wood a worn and weathered pine
Bound together tightly with bits of wire and twine
The weeds grew up between the stones that marked that narrow grave
And I wondered who so long ago had in this ground been laid
We know now what became of him, but not from where he came
Were his last days filled with loneliness with sorrow or with pain
And who was left behind to grieve and make this humble tomb
And who has come before me to his place of final doom
How did he make his way in life will in death he do the same
Was his soul possessedof goodness of sorrow or of shame
And does this cross above him mean he was a christian man
Or did he believe this earthly death for him would mean the end
I stood there in the silence and felt a deathly chill
Wonderin’ if my own short life could end upon some hill
With noone left behind to make a place for me to lay
With a handmade cross and stones around to mark a six foot grave

Well I wish was in London
Or some other seaport town
Step my foot in a steamboat
And sail the ocean round
   Sailing round the ocean
   Sailing round the sea
   I’d think of Handsome Molly
   Wherever she may be
I saw her at church last Sunday
She passed me on by
I knew her mind was changing
By the roving of her eye
Her hair as black as a Raven’s
Her eyes were black as coal
Her teeth shown like lilies
Out in the morning cold
Now do you remember Molly
When you give me your right hand
Said if you ever married
I’d be your man
Now you’ve broke your promise
Go marry whom you please
My heart is broken
‘Til I get some ease

Oh does your concience ever bother you
Every time you hear my name
Oh try to think of all that I’ve gone through
And hang your head in shame
Someone came along and took my place
Then you gave me all the blame
Oh you should go somewhere and hide your face
and hang your head in shame
Now when you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game
Oh try to think of all the harm you’ve done
And hang you head in shame
I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I’ve kept a flame
Dear you’ll be sorry darling yes you will

I wondered today on the sea shore
The waves and the winds are low
I thought of the days gone by Maud
Many long years ago
We lingered by the gently flowing billows
And watch the golden sunset fade away
And there among the sweet ocean breezes
We talked about our future wedding day
   Gathering up the shells from the sea shore
   Gathering up the shells from the sea
   Those were the happiest days of all Maud
   Gathering up the shells from the shore
When the waves are rolling on the ocean
And the golden moonbeams on the pebbles shine
At your cottage by the sea I’ll come again Maud
When the waves are rolling gently sweetheart mine
Now I am growing up in years Maud
My locks are all silver and gray
But the vows that we made on the shore Maud
Are fresh in my memory today
No more bright shells we will gather
As the waves come dashing as of yore
She lies neath the white pebbled sand
Just covered up with shells on the shore

To his owners He loved
The sheep that had wandered astray
They heard not His voice

For my precious savior always listens in
He will rescue you today in that same old fashioned way
For my precious savior always listens in

On Saturday night when our work is done
We load our music up on the run
   Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
   We got to ramble ramble there’s heavy traffic ahead
We pull out of Nashville right on time
The Blue Grass special heads down the line
We traveled around from state to state
The Bluegrass boys are never late
Late in the evening about sundown
You know we’ve come from some other town
We do our work with a good will
On Friday night we head for Nashville

Thinking of you while out for a ramble
Down by a cold frosty stream
Set down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
And gently I fell into a dream
I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty I’d never saw before
Her dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So green was the mantel she wore
Her hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was as ivory so white
Her eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Or stars than shine on a cold frosty night
I drew her near then I awakened
With two empty arms and you on my mind
Heaven seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to know you left me behind

And her lonely arms keep reaching for someone that she needs
The teardrops are falling on my cheeks
Cause I can hear her sweet love’s calling me

And somewhere you’re dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gay life takes the place of our dream
High on a hilltop my heart cries oh Lord
Forgive her she know not the way
And give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we’ll pray
I can vision a rounder with a life so smooth
And a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger cause you’re silly with booze
And high on a hilltop I see a devil win you

With these Highway 40 blues
I’ve walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I’ve been gone
And I’d love to see the lights of home
Wasted time and money too
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I’d have to lose
Lord above, I’ve paid my dues
I’ve got them Highway 40 blues. 
 The highway called when I was young
It told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead
That’s what the billboard light had said
Shattered dreams my mind is numb
Money’s gone stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord, I ain’t been home in years
I got them Highway 40 blues. 
 You know I rambled all around
Like a rolling stone from town to town
Met pretty girls I’d have to say
But none of them could make me stay
I’ve played the music halls and bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars
Things a country boy can’t use
Dixie land I sure miss you
I’ve got them Highway 40 blues.

I never thought this thing could happen

Your face is always there before me

In the beautiful hills, way back in Roane Country
There’s where I roamed for many long years
There’s where my heart’s been tending most ever
That’s where the first step of misfortune I made
I was about thirty years when I courted and married
Amanda Gilbraith I then called my wife
But her brother stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three months later I’d taken Tom’s life
For twenty five years this whole world I rambled
I went to old England to France and to Spain
But I thought of my home way back in Roan Country
I boarded a steamer and came back again
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in the county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next morning
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
When the train pulled out poor mother stood weepin
And sister she sat alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was Willie God bless you
Was Willie God bless you, God bless you, good bye
Sweet Martha was grave but Corey was better
There’s better and worse, although you can see
Boys when you write home from the prison in Nashville
Place one of my songs in your letter for me

Riding on an east bound freight train speeding thru the night
Hobo Bill a railroad bum was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold
No warm lights flicker ’round him no blankets there to fold
Nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreary kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay
Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcare door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped thru the darkness and the raging storm outside
No-one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride
It was early in the morning when they raised the Hobo’s head
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead
There was no mother’s longing to soothe his weary soul
For he was just a railroad bum who died out in the cold

I gotta move gotta move God

Some women try to hold me but I keep on movin’ on
My hat don’t hang in nowhere for too long
‘Cause I’m caught up in the feeling of the singin’ brakemans song

All the neon lights were flashin’ and the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes and the drizzle turned to snow
His eyes were red his hopes were dead and the wine was runnin’ low
Then the old man came home from the forest
His tears fell on the sidewalk as he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare but no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway and a bottle his only friend
And the old man stumbled in from the forest
Up a dark and dingy staircase the old man made his way
His ragged coat around him as upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened that he ended up this way
Gettin’ lost like a fool in the forest
And as he lay there sleepin’ a vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining the face of one so dear
Who’d loved him in the springtime of a long forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom in the forest
She touched his grizzled fingers and she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside in some forgotten town
Where the river runs down from the forest
With a mighty roar the big jets soar above the canyon streets
And the common con but life goes on for the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier the dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home from the forest

No matter whose holding you your heart is still mine
Every time I think about the way you cuddled up and spuddled up
And thrilled me with your charm
I get dizzy in the head and when it’s seeming that I’m dreaming
I’m locked in your loving arms

People steal they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don’t they know on judgement day
That gold and silver will melt away

And to know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
What good is gold and silver too
If your hearts not pure and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

And I dreamed no one else had your heart

And told me that we’d never part
Oh how could I dream such a dream
How peaceful there while I sleep
But I awoke how strange it did seem
I was lost in a world so deep
You’ll never know just how much I love you
And that you’re in my prayers every night
But tonight you’re in the arms of another
And I know what I’m feeling ain’t right

And the flowers are still growing on the lawn

How I miss my darling since she’s gone
She’s gone to join a happy band of angels
To sing for endless ages at God’s throne
The best friend I ever had is now with Jesus

There’ll never be another friend like Mother
No one can do the things for me she done
Nor can fill the vacant place she left here

And every day I ask myself how lonely can you get

And if my life is filled with pain and sorrow
I guess it’s only right that I should pay

Last night while I lay sleeping
Last night while in a dream
I saw my dear old mother
Down by a misting stream
   Don’t ask me why I’m weeping
   Don’t ask me why I pray
   For I’ve an aged mother
   Ten thousand miles away
A letter here from sister dear
Come home we’re all alone
Dear mother’s slowly fading
She cant be living long
Yodel
Out in the cold world
Long ways from home
I’m drawing near the old home
Dear sister’s at the gate
She’s leading me through the doorway
Oh brother you’ve come to late
   Oh lead me to the casket
   Through back the linen so fine
   That I may kiss her pale white lips
   For I know they’ll never kiss mine
I see the pale moon shining
On mother’s whitened stone
The rose buds round them twining
Are just me all alone
Yodel
Out in the cold world
Left all alone

I hear the low winds sweeping
Through every bush and tree
Where my dear mother’s sleeping
Away from home and me
    Cold in the grave she’s lying
    And sorrow shapes my brow
    She’s gone from me to Heaven
    I have no mother now
I see the pale moon shining
On mother’s white tombstone
With roses o’er entwining
They’re just like me and her
    They’re just me a weeping
    As sorrow shapes my brow
    She’s gone from me to heaven
    I have no mother now
Sad was the hour of parting
In a voice so low and sweet
She said loved ones I’m dying
We must in Heaven meet
    Oh yes we’ll meet dear mother   
    On that eternal shore
    And dwell as one in Heaven   
    Where parting comes no more
    Oh yes we’ll meet dear mother   
    On that eternal shore
    And dwell as one in Heaven   
    Where parting comes no more

It was on last Sunday evening
Just about the hour of three
When my darling started to leave me
And sail on the deep blue sea 
He promised to write me a letter,
He promised to write to me;
And I haven’t heard from my darling,
Who is sailing on the deep blue sea 
My mother is dead and buried
My father’s forsaken me
And I have no one to love me
But the sailor on the deep blue sea 
“Oh, captain, can you tell me,
Can you tell me where he may be?”
“Oh yes, my little maiden,
He’s drownded in the deep blue sea” 
Farewell to friends and relations
This is the last you’ll see of me,
I’m going to end my troubles
By drowning in the deep blue sea

While walking one day in the country
I saw a gathering crowd
And as my footsteps drew me closer
I smelled the sweet fragrance of flowers
It looking like a family reunion
had my eyes not counted the tears
And an old man sat by a graveyard
I haven’t seen Mary in years
Hold to my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary
I haven’t seen Mary in years
When Mary and I were first married
we had such plans for our child
But for no reason I started rambling
and like the four winds I just went wild
If I could live my life over
I would bring Mary such cheer
Now she’s gone where she’ll never meet me
I haven’t seen Mary in years
Then the old man left the graveyard
and I walked right by his side
I called his name but through all his shame
his son he did not recognize
Hold to my hand and lead me
lead me away from here
How could I know it was Mama
I haven’t seen Mary in years

Took me to Atlanta boys and tied me to a ball and chain

She said she was sad and lonely told me that her love was true
Then I dreamed I wrote her a letter saying honey I’m coming back to you

And asked me for a quarter
Or if I knew a good cheap place to eat 
Well I just shrugged my shoulders
Said, “If I could help you brother
I wouldn’t be out walkin’ on the street 
With nothin’ more to say
Just turned and walked away
Hopin’ for a richer man to meet. 
   I long for the old home
   I long for the hills
   Swingin’ on the front porch
   Lord knows I ain’t had my fill. 
Well I left home at fifteen
With a guitar and a dream
And a heart that needs learnin’ more of life 
I never had a job long
I never was the kind
To settle down forever with a wife 
I may have met some men
That you read about in books
And there were times that I was livin’ right 
But I ain’t got much to show
Here livin’ on skid row
No one to help this old man through the night.

Oh father mother is sick at home
And sister cries for bread
He turned around went in at the door
He staggered up to the bar
And faltering on to the landlord sayin’
Just give me one dram more
A year or so I passed thereby
And a crowd stood round the door
When I asked the reason one replied
The drunkard is no more
Just then a hearse moved slowly by
No wife nor children near
They had gone before this foul murder
And left this world of care
Come all you jolly dram drinkers
By this a warning take
And quit the overflowing bowl
Before it is too late

   I wish you knew how hard I’ve tried to tell you
   How hard I’ve tried to get you off my mind
   I wish you knew how hard I’ve tried to sleep at night
   Since I know that you’re no longer mine
   Since you let another beat my time
If only half the things were true you say about my heart
Then I would have forgotten you since we’ve been apart
You said I forced my lips to kiss you when we said goodbye
You even said I forced the tears that came into my eyes
There’s not a thought that could be worse than knowing that you’re gone
But in the picture in your mind I’m never all alone
You see me in another’s arms just like I’ve been with you
By the way I cry for you each night I only wish you knew

Well I wonder how the old folks are at home
I wonder if they miss me while I roam
I wonder if they pray for the boy who went away
And left his dear old parents all alone
You could hear the cattle lowing in the lane
You could see the fields of blue grass where I’ve grown
You could almost hear them cry as they kissed their boy goodbye
Well I wonder how the old folks are at home
Just a village and a homestead on the farm
And a mother’s love to shield you from all harm
A mother’s love so true a sweetheart that loves you
A village and a homestead on the farm

Tonight I’m sad my heart is weary
Wondering if I’m wrong or right
To think about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight
   The rain is cold and slowly falling
   Upon my window pane tonight
   And though your love seems even colder
   I wonder where you are tonight
Your heart was cold you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you’ve gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight

Your letter came this very day
And it wiped all my dreams away
I’ve read it o’er a thousand times
You left me with a worried mind
    I wonder why you said goodbye
    And did you mean to make me cry
    I guess until the day I die
    That I will still be wondering why.
I dread the thought that we are through
And that you’ve found somebody new
I love you now and always will
I’d rather die than say farewell
I hope and pray before my time
That you’ll come back and say you’re mine
Bring back the love you took away
And mend the heart you broke today

I worship you and the things you do
Still you’re not satisified
I paid the cost I’ve loved and lost
But still I worship you
When we first met and loved we were always side by side
Never then did I think you’d go wrong
But you started goin’ round with the wrong kind of crowd
To my sorrow I’ve found you’ve gone wrong
I go back to our home and I lie awake ’til dawn
Still I can’t get you out of my life
And my friends say next day what a price you must pay
Last night I saw someone with your wife

If I could be what I’d like to be
I’d like to be a train
Cause trains don’t have no heart to break
And they don’t feel no pain
If love was wine a sweet red wine
I drink away my pain
I’d drink until my heart was filled
With love instead of shame
Why can’t love be like a hickory tree
That stands so strong and tall
Why can’t I find a heart that’s true
Who’ll never say goodbye
Oh what a shame you’ll never change
I guess I always knew
But there’s no girl in the whole wide world
I’d love as much as you

I’d rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than to be in your arms but never in your heart
Well I’ve just received your letter you asked me to come home
You say you’re sorry that you went away
This is an old old story and I’ve heard it all before
So darlin’ this is all that I can say
I tried so hard my darlin’ to make you love me then
‘Cause you would always leave me here alone
And although I could forgive you things would be the same
Nothing could ever change your heart of stone

   Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smiles tonight 
Oh when the dance commences, Oh how I will rejoice
I’ll sing the songs he taught me without a faulting voice
When the flattering ones come around me they’ll think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smile tonight 
And when the room he entered with a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him as though he was a charm
And once he smiled upon her as once he’d smiled at me
They knew not what I suffered, they found no change in me 
And when the dance is over and all have gone to rest
I’ll think of him, dear Mother, the one that I love best
He once did love me dearly and ne’er from me would part
He sought not to deceive me, false friends have changed his heart

I was standing by the bedside of a neighbor
Who was just about to cross the swelling tide
I asked if she would do me a favor
Just take a message to the other side
If you see my savior tell Him that you saw me
When you saw me I was on my way
You may meet some old friends who may ask about me
Just tell them I’ll be home some day
Now you’ll have to take this journey on without me
It’s a debt that soon or later must be paid
If you see my savior don’t forget to tell Him
Don’t forget to tell him what I say
You may chance to see my father or my mother
Or some friends who have gone before
You may chance to see my sister or my brother
But try to see my savior first of all

To be at home with you again

Perhaps you’ll love the only life you’ll ever understand
I’ll find another woman go find you another man
You said that you’re not happy with a baby on your knee
So you leave it all alone and go stepping out on me
Well every night you’re on your way to that wild side of life
You can’t stand the thought to be a mother or a wife
It seems you don’t care about the kind of life you choose
You know that if you ramble some day you’re gonna lose
This big world around you will tumble in your hand
I’ll have me another woman
you’ll need another man
Down this highway of sorrow I’ll leave to you alone
For I know you’ll always feel that same old tumbling stone
Another man will see you and than he’ll stumble on
He’ll be a victum of a woman that’s gone away

So many things in this land I shall ne’er understand
I’ll talk it all over with Him
I’ll still be true to my Lord as we live in accord

I once had a sweetheart to love me
But now she has proven untrue
She’s found a new love to treasure
That’s why I’m walking round blue
The lies you told me are over
The heart you broke is gone
And friends they tell me I’m lucky
I’m better off now that you’re gone
You broke my heart when you loved me
I’ve always counted on you
But now you’ve strayed with another
LIttle girl what more could I do
Some day I know you’ll be sorry
You led my poor heart astray
You seemed to think it was funny
But some say darling you’ll pay
I’m better off now that you’re gone

Lights up a purple sky

Just like a wandering Jew that had no place to choose
Each day I had to keep travelin’ on
But now I’ve found the way that leads to endless days

When Satan would alarm I climb in God’s strong arm
And hide away in his loving embrace

Friends tell me that told you wed another
They say you look so happy all the time
I just can’t realize that I have lost you
Somehow I thought you always would be mine
I’ve love you since the day that I first met you
I thought no one could ever come between
Those promises you made have all been broken
And all I have to live for now is grief
Somehow I can’t believe that you’ll be happy
With memories to haunt you night and day
But only time can make you learn your lesson
I’m sure you think you’ve reached your goal today
I never thought someday that I would lose you
You’re just the kind that never could be true
You only wanted me just for a while dear
Just long enough to break my heart in two

At the same old Place like I used to do

You can’t conceal a heart that is broken
And a love like mine will never die
I can’t explain how I felt when you left me
All I know is I wanted to die

I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
The moon has even lost it’s glow the sun don’t shine anymore
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
   Since you’ve gone I’ve cried to myself
   Told my heart there’s nothing left
   I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
   I’ve walked the floor the streets of town
   Guess I’ll never live it down
   I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
I heard that lonesome whistle blow seen lonesome midnights come and go
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
Seen days I thought would never end when only blues come creeping in
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
My love for her will linger on even though she’s done me wrong
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
So I’ll just live my life alone maybe some day she’ll come home
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life

For thinking about that woman I love run away with another man

I bought her everything she needs I dressed her up so fine
She caused me to work for forty years I’ve still got ninety nine
I’ve still got ninety nine poor boy I’ve still got ninety nine
She caused me to work for forty years I’ve still got ninety nine
I stroll down to the old depot just to watch the train roll by
I looked in the window saw the woman I loved hung down my head and cried
Hung down my head and cried poor boy hung down my head and cried
I looked in the window saw the woman I loved hung down my head and cried
They took me down to the old jailhouse the door they slammed on me
Said if you’ll report that moonshine still I’ll see that you got free
I’ll see that you go free poor boy I’ll see that you go free
If you’ll report that moonshine still I’ll see that you go free
I told my age was twenty one the truth I told that time
Before I’ll report that moonshine still I’ll go and serve my time

She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting still his love I seek that home above
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day
Within the old home place her patient smiling face
Was always spreading comfort hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the songs the angels loved to hear
My work on earth is done the life crown has been won
And she will be at rest with Him above
And some glad morning she I know will welcome me
To that eternal home of peace and love

   And find the man I lost back home again.
It’s been awhile since I’ve been home
I miss the place I come from and the smell of the old wood smoke
I close my eyes I can see all of my favorite memories
How I wish I could go back home again.

The night owl sings a song I know the darkness seems an old familiar friend
The falling rain and gentle winds rock my soul to sleep again
A quiet place this peaceful dream of home.

Four hunderd miles or more until I reached my next show.
The wind was blowing cold and brother don’t you know
This pain inside my heart just won’t let go.
I never was one to follow a straight and narrow path
But I would now if it would lead me to my past.
Back to her loving arms is where I want to go
To the one who left me out in the cold.
   If I could turn back the hands of time
   To the day when she was mine
   If she’d take me back right now
   I would walk the line
   If I could turn back the hands of time.
She never wanted me to leave her all alone
She needed someone there to keep her warm at home
Her words now are so clear in my mind
If I had only read between the lines.
I’ll play another smoke filled bar for tips in a jar
Another lonely night just me and my guitar
But if she would open up her heart to me again
I’d stop running down this road that has no end.

I feel as though I slighted you I cannot hear you mourn
So here’s my heart come take it and claim it as your own
I wrote her back an answer I sent it back in speed
I only once did love you I loved you dear indeed

There I see a grassy mound
There my sweetheart lies a-sleeping
In the cold and silent ground
Gently waves the weeping willow
Birds they warble sweet and low
And there’s no one left to love me
Since my sweetheart had to go
In that little village churchyard
There I stray with a broken heart
There is no one left to love me
Since the day we had to part
That sad day will I remember
When she called me to her side
How I watched her spirit fading
And the tears did blind my sight
Then she said, ‘Goodbye my darling
Dry those teardrops from your eyes
Promise me, my little darling
That you’ll meet me up on high’
In that little village churchyard
There I stray with a broken heart
There is no one left to love me
Since the day we had to part
Oft I’ve wandered to the graveyard
Flowers to plant with tender care
O’er the grave of my dear darling
Darkness finds me weeping there

In a straight back chair on two legs, leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a-playin’ with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin’ fireflies when evening shadows fall.
    In my Tennessee mountain home, life is peaceful as a baby’s sigh
    In my Tennessee mountain home, crickets sing in the fields nearby. 
Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence upon the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads its wings
And a songbird on a fencepost sings a melody 
Walking home from church on sunday with the one you love
Just laughin’, talkin’, making future plans
And when the folks aren’t looking you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin’ in the porch swing holdin’ hands.

With the beauties and the music of the woods
The sweet song of the bright bubbling fountain
and the warble of the birds I understood 
   When I’ve sung my last song in the evening
   And the sun sets in the golden west
   All the scenes of this world I’ll be leaving
   In the shadow of Clinch Mountain I will rest
Long ago said the oak and the cedar
Singing deeply in a whisper of the past
Stood not then this great towering leader
nor the fountain where the crystal gems are kept (passed?)
Then I asked how this green lofty mountain
in the caldron the lonely desert stood
Said this song of the bright sunny fountain
We were given by the waters of the flood 
Out that gate I have passed since my childhood
O’er the railway through the tunnel to the west
singing songs of the Clinch Mountain wildwoods
Song that people found and birds loved the best

You went away and not a word was said
While my throbbing heart was breaking underneath its load of pride
And the pine trees sobbed in pity o’er my head

And reunite in the shadow of the pines

To the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
When I left her all alone
In our Shenandoah home
She promised she’d be waiting there for me
But the angels came along
And took her from our home
From the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
When the evening shadows fall

A pledge when giving her a ring

You drove those country back roads to a thousand one-night stands
The music from your mandolin, spread like wildfire in the wind
And echoed through the hollows and the hills, so tell me, Bill
   Is the grass any bluer on the other side
   Did it look like gold Kentucky when the gates swung open wide
   Bet the good Lord’s got you playin’ somewhere up there every night
   Is the grass any bluer on the other side
I heard you on the Opry when I was just a kid
I tried my best to learn to sing and play the way you did
Just like me the day you died, the guitars and the fiddles cried
The music ain’t the same without you Bill, we miss you still

Will I walk this dark and lonely road again
Is there one more hope for this heartbreak
Is there one last chance or goodbye
If I had one wish I would end all this heartache
Oh I wonder how long I could cry
You could count the stars in heaven
You could count a million waves on the sea
You’ll never know how many teardrops
That I shed for somethin’ never meant to be
Without love in this lifetime
You can count on little boys bein’ blue
So don’t wait until tomorrow
You may never find yourself a love so true

It’s only the wind
Your children are not at the door
It’s only the wind

Of her son and her daughter so fair

Send this message to dad and his engine

In something less than an hour

Tell wife I’ll be there at midnight
I’m praying for her too
I left my son in the office
Took the message to Jim’s wife
There I found the dying woman
Was scarce of breath and life
O’er hill and dale and valley
Thunders the heavy train
His engine is sobbing and throbbing
And under a terrible strain
But Jim hangs onto his throttle
Guiding her crazy flight
And his voice cries out in the darkness
God speed the express tonight
I telephoned the doctor
How is Jim’s wife I asked
About the hour of midnight
Is long as she can last
In something less than an hour
The train will be along
But here I have a message
Oh god there is something wrong
The message reads disaster
The train is in the ditch
The engineer is dying
Derailed by an open switch
And there is another message
To Jim’s wife it is addressed

Wait for the fast express

But he rose over all eternity
There’s many here on this journey
So heavy the burdens they bear
As they reach up toward the heaven
He’ll hear their voices in prayer

Julianne what are you doing, making plans on leaving me?
Have I made your life unhappy, is this how it’s got to be?
Will you be here in the morning when the rooster starts to crow?
Will my tears be all that’s called for Julianne? I’ve got to know
   Dress yourself in silk and satin, put some ribbons in your hair
   But don’t say you’re gonna leave me, it’s more than I can bear
   Go and have your night of dancing if you like those country songs
   But when all the fun is over, Julianne, come on home
Julianne, you know I love you, I can’t live my life alone
Is there some way I can please you, tell me what could keep you home
I’ve got no gold and silver, got no diamonds for your hand
All I have is love, this love I’ll give you Oh, I need you, Julianne

Just a few more days of sorrow just a few more days of pain
Just a few more days of cloudiness Just a few more days of rain
Then I’m gonna live Jesus he has got a home prepared
Then I’ll join the Holy Angels mother will be waiting there
Not so long ago one morning mother called me to her bed
Then she put her arms around me listen to what she said
Darlin I am going to leave you but you’ll not be left alone
Jesus will protect and shield you after he has called me home
Sometimes I am sorely tempted sometimes I am sorely tried
But to overcome I’m trying taking Jesus for my guide
Though sometimes the path seems rugged but it only makes me pray
And I know if I keep trying I’ll see my mother some sweet day

I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
   Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
   Let us tell Him all about our troubles
   He will hear our faintest cry
   He will answer by and by
   Now when you feel a little prayerwheel turning
   And you know a little fire is burning
   You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Sometimes my path seems drear without a ray of cheer
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to Him in prayer He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Makes everything right

To make a big to-do
Just have some good old-time singing

They stood on the beach one evening
Out in the moonlight fair
Twas a boy in the pride of manhood
And a girl in beauty rare
I never had thought that you loved me
An innocent look of surprise
Crept out from beneath her lashes
And into those deep brown eyes
   
   Oh sir I was only flirting
   Only a playing a part
   Just another boy’s life ruined
   Just another broken heart
Sir I’m to be married this winter
Farewell and she gave me her hand
And drawing a robe around her
She left me alone on the sand
He goes with a crowd of passers
Always bitter and cold
Just another boy grown weary
Just another boy grown old
There’s a rose grows in your garden
White rose is the symbol of peace
And when I am dead little darling
Plant that rose at my head and my feet
   Oh sir I was only flirting
   Only a playing a part
   Just another boy’s life ruined
   Just another broken heart

Without my baby by my side
This empty feeling now inside me
Is bound to show but I can’t cry
Just make mine straight without a chaser
And let me drown my blues this way
The seat beside me now is empty
Nothing to live for just another day
A thief could rob and take my money
If death was pending I could pray
I’m helpless now what can my fate be
Everything is gone just another day

Why don’t you let me sing my songs there’s other girls to woo

By his side sat Running Elk his longtime Indian friend
He vowed that he would stay by Jack until the bitter end
Jack had gambled everything he owned to leave this wondering life
He might have had a happy home and a tender loving wife
But his hunger was for trading trapper’s furs for turquoise stones
Anything that the Indians had Jack wanted for his own
Said Jack to Running Elk I’ll gamble all my precious stones
Before I leave my body here among these bleaching bones
Though now my time is drawing near and I’m filled with dark regrets
My spirit longs to journey as the sun begins to set
We raped and killed we stole your land
We rule with guns and knives add whiskey to your waters
While we stole away your wives
said Running Elk what’s done is done you white men rule this land
so lay the cards face up and play your last broken hearted hand

When your dealing cards with death the joker’s wild the ace is high

Jack saw him with the sun and room and upped him with the stars

Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you’ll say that you forever long to be mine
Think of the heartaches, the sorrows and tears you will save
When you are lonely and tired of another man’s gold
When you are weary, remember this letter, my own
Don’t try to answer though I’ll suffer anguish unknown
If you don’t love me I wish you would leave me alone
While I am writing this letter I think of our past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this old world, I’ll soon say my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me

And carry a load in each hand
But I’ll not need one thing that I’ve used in this world
When I move to that heavenly land
Everything that I’ll need will be furnished up there
Not even my song books I’ll bring
Or the precious old Bible that showed me the way
I’ll not need when I stand by my King

Well that last train done left town
The last train done left town
I heard the whistle moaning low
But that last train done left town. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Now my sweet baby’s on that train
My sweet baby’s on that train
I wonder if I will see her again
But that last train’s done gone down. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Now the whistle’s moaning low
The whistle is moaning low
I begged my baby please don’t go
But that last train’s done gone down. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Now I’m sorry for what I’ve done
I’m sorry for what I’ve done
To leave behind your baby crying
But that last train’s done gone down. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Well that last train done left town

Well it was good one time everything was mighty fine
The coal tipples roared day and night
But things they got slow for no reason that I know
And ill winds they hove into sight
The mines all closed down everybody laid around
There wasn’t very much left to do
Except stand in that line to get your ration script on time
And woman I could see it killin’ you
Now the soft new snows of December
Lightly fall my cabin ’round And the last train from Poor Valley
Takin’ brown haired Becky Richmond bound
It’s been a comin’ on and on lord soon you would be gone
Leavin’ crossed your mind every day
Then you said to me things are bad back home you see
I guess I better be on my way
Well I should blame you know but I never could somehow
A miner’s wife you weren’t cutout to be
It wasn’t what you thought just some dreams that you’d bought
When you left home and ran away with me

Darling, clasp me to your bosom
As you did in days of yore
Lay your hand upon my forehead
Ere I reach the golden shore
Life is from me fastly falling
Soon I’ll be in sweet repose
When I’m gone 1 ask this favor
Lay my head beneath the rose
Darling, first you said you loved me
When you gave me hand and heart
There were roses on your cheeks, love
As we vowed we ne’er would part
One more kiss for I am going
Far beyond all earthly woe
May your life be like your cheeks, love
Covered with the blossomed rose
He has crossed the shadowed valley
Where the living waters flow
Love has answered all his pleading
And he sleeps in sweet repose
Beneath a grassy mound he’s resting
Where the golden sunset glows
Love has answered all his pleading
And he sleeps in sweet repose

All your money won’t help you get through the great gates of heaven
All your power cannot help you over there
If you find you’ve been living here for the almighty dollar
You’ll never have a mansion over there
   Just like the rich man who wouldn’t give a crumb from his table
   He found in the end from God he couldn’t run
   He found himself in the depths of hell looking up at poor Lazarus
   Crying just a drop of water to cool my tongue
There’s been many a man who’s had it all in this life
Thought he had it under control
In the end he found himself begging for God’s mercy
In the end he found he’d lost his soul
There is victory ahead for those who hear and listen
Who trust in God in spite of great despair
For Jesus is our shield and our great high tower
And he promised to deliver us with prayer
   Just like when Lazarus reached heaven and he looked down at the rich man
   Who had no hope when his race was run
   He stood down there in the depths of hell looking up at poor Lazarus
   Crying just a drop of water to cool my tongue

Gathered there around that stranger
Saying God bless you welcome home

If I die before you do one request I ask you please

Where the cries of the wolf hungy winds mournful sigh
High above our little cabin lay my bones there to rest
Where the wild birds and critters still make their little nests

And the lights coming over the hill are a blinding me

Between the rain and the lights on the hill are a blindin’ me
It’s a long tough road from a way down south
A mans gotta find a little food for his mouth
And a home for a girl as sweet as honey can be

And it’s gonna crack beneath the strain

In the arms and in the heart of some new love

Hug me close dear mother closer
Put your arms around me tight
For I am cold and tired, dear mother
And I feel so strange tonight
Something hurts me here, dear mother
Like a stone upon my breast
Oh I wonder, wonder mother
Why it is I cannot rest
All the day as you were working
And I lay upon my bed
I was trying to be patient
And to think of what you said
How the King, Blessed Jesus
Loves His lambs to watch and keep
Oh, I wish He would come and take m
In His arms that I might sleep
Just before the lamps were lighted
Just before the children came
While the room was very quiet
I heard someone call my name
All at once a window opened
On a field of lambs and sheep
Some far out were in a brook drinking
Some were lying fast asleep
In a moment I was looking
On a world so bright and fair
Which was filled with little children
And they seemed so happy there
They were singing oh so sweetly
Sweetest songs I ever heard
They were singing sweeter mother
Than our own little birds
But I could not see the Savior
Though I strained my eyes to see
And I wonder if He saw me
Would He speak to such as me
All at once a window opened
One so bright upon me smiled
And I knew it must be Jesus
When He said come here, my child
Come up here, little Bessie
Come up here and live with me
Where little children never suffer
Suffer through eternity
Then I thought of all you told me
Of that bright and happy land
I was going when you called me
When you came and kissed my hand
And at first I felt so sorry
You had called, I would go
Oh, to sleep and never suffer
Mother, don’t be crying so 
Hug me close dear mother closer
Put your arms around me tight
Oh how much I love you mother
And how strong I feel tonight
And her mother pressed her closer
To her own dear burdened breast
On the heart so near it’s breaking
Lay the heart so near it’s rest
At the solemn hour of midnight
In the darkness calm and deep
Laying on her mother’s bosom
Little Bessie fell asleep

With a baby on my knee

We’d sail to the island Coney
There used to be a medicine man come around
everybody called him a phony
But I thought he was a king when I heard him ring
A big bell on the little black pony
He was riding on a little black pony.
I said oh mister what can I give you
I haven’t got much money
But I’ll do anything even try to sing
if you’ll let me have that pony
I gotta have that little black pony.
He said son learn to play the banjo
All the old tunes happy and lonely
And I’ll be back this way someday
And you can have that pony
you can have that little black pony.
Well the old man he never came back
But I never once thought he was a phony
I just guess he must have realized
he couldn’t do without that pony
He couldn’t live without that little black pony.
Mr. Lee moved away and got a job in the city
That’s the last I saw of Joanie
But I can’t forget the cardboard boats
and I still love little black ponies
I still love little black ponies.

   There’s a little black train a comin
   Set your business right
   There’s a little black train a comin
   And it may be here tonight
   Go tell that ball room lady
   All dressed in the worldly pride
   That death’s dark train is coming
   Prepare to take a ride
God sent to Hezikai
A message from on high
You better set your house in order
For you must surely die
He turned to the wall in weeping
We see and hear his tears
He got his business fixed all right
God spared him fifteen years
We see that train with engine
And one small baggage car
Your idle thoughts and wicked deeds
Will stop at the judgment bar
That poor young man in darkness
Cares not for the gospel light
Til suddenly he hears the whistle blow
And the little black train in site
Have mercy on me lord
Please come and set me right
Before he got his business fixed
The train rolled in that night

Tonight I’m alone without you my dear
It seems there’s a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill
   Oh, someone has taken you from me
   And left me here all alone
   Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
   In our little cabin home on the hill
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there’s a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won’t be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there’s no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill

I was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
My soul was in darkness had been there for many a day
In that little community church yard I heard the gospel song
I went inside to kneel and pray
    Oh I knelt down and prayed to my Savior
    That He might hear and would accept me
    Then I felt the Holy Spirit
    I knew my soul was saved in me 
In that little community church house that’s where we sing and pray
We pray to our Father to guide us on our way
All through life’s long journey we’ll need His helping hand
Until we reach that promised land
In that little community church house among my many friends
I can hear them praying for me and the preacher saying ‘amen’
And a vision there before me it was my Savior’s face
I knew that I was saved by Grace

Little country preacher with his head bowed down in prayer
I know that he’s in conference with our Load away up there
He’s not hightened with his speech just plain like you and me
He reminds me of the prophets and the man of Galilee
He started out when just a lad to preach the gospel way
And when the path got hard to trod with mother he would stay
The money did not bother him for Christ he took his stand
His pay day will be paid to him at the gates of Glory Land
The little church he preaches at each Sunday for our aske
If you pass it by and don’t go in you’ve made a big mistake
His good old fashioned voice pleads stranger enter in
God’s pleading through good men to save us from our sins

Dreaming of your amber skies
Was a poor boy broken-hearted
Listening to the winds that sigh
My little darlin’ oh how I love you
How I love you none can tell
In your heart you love another

Many a day with you I’ve rambled
Happiest hours with you I’ve spent

There is just three things I wish for

When I’m dead don’t weep for me
Just kiss those lips that you betrayed

Now come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
   Way down in the blue ridge mountains
   Way down where the tall pines grow
   Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
   She’s my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn’t stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart

Lost in the woods she couldn’t hear a sound
She was our darling girl the sweetest thing in all the world
We searched for her but she couldn’t be found

   I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary woods
   But I reached our darling girl too late
Oh I began to cry I knew that soon she’d have to die
For the snake was warning me close by
I held her close to my face she said daddy kill that snake

They need your love to guide them along

Many years have passed away and gone
Since I left my old native home
Since I left the scenes of my childhood there
Where the dark days seem to roam
I left my aged father there
And my mother so dear unto me
I left a brother and a sister fair
And a little girl that played upon my knee
Don’t Ginny remember, will she ever forget
Those many hours of pleasure to me
Does she sigh when she thinks of those many happy hours
When a little girl she played upon my knee
I am homeward bound with the thrills of joy
Of my wandering so far o’er the sea
I shall soon see my home, my old native home
And the little girl that played upon my knee
I am tired of life, I cannot live
In this dark world so weary unto me
Come bury me low by the one I love so well
By the little girl that played upon my knee

At my wedding my little wife you’ll be
Oh Willie dear, let’s both consider
We’re both too young to be married now
When we’re married, we’re bound together
Let’s stay single just one more year
He went to the bar where she was dancing
A jealous thought came to his mind
I’ll kill that girl, my own true lover
Before I let another man beat my time
He went to the bar and called her to him
She said Willie dear, what you want with me
Come and drink wine with the one that loves you
More than anyone else you know, said he
While they were at the bar a-drinking
That same old thought came to his mind
He’d kill that girl, his own true lover
He gave her poison in a glass of wine
She laid her head over on his shoulder
Said Willie dear, please take me home
That glass of wine that I’ve just drinken
Has gone to my head and got me drunk
He laid his head over on the pillow
Let me read you the law let me tell you my mind
Molly dear, I’m sorry to tell you

They folded their arms around each other
They cast their eyes unto the sky

My father, he’s the king of the gypsies, it is true
My mother, she learned me some camping for to do
With my pack all on my back my friends all wished me well
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
As I was a-walking upon a London street
A handsome young squire was the first I chanced to meet
He view-ed my brown cheeks and he liked them so well
He said, “My little gypsy girl, will you my fortune tell?”
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
Oh yes sir, oh kind sir, please give to me your hand
It’s you that have fine fortune, both houses and good land
The fairer girls are dainty, but you must cast them by
For it is the little gypsy girl who is to be your bride
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
He took me to his castle, there were carpets on the floor
And servants there a-awaiting for to open every door
There were ladies there of honor and the music it did play
And all were there to celebrate the gypsy’s wedding day
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
So it’s farewell to the gypsy life, to camping on the green
No more with my brothers and my sisters I’ll be seen

With servants for to wait on me and in my carriage ride

I am always dreaming of my little home
Back among the hills of Tennessee
I am always yearning, longing to return
To the place that means the world to me 
Just a little shack roof all turning black
Still it’s a place there to me
Song birds always singing round the kitchen door
Of my little home in Tennessee 
I can see my mother standing by the gate
As I drove the old horse up the lane
She would never scold me when I came home late
How I wish that I had never cause her pain 
Just a tender smile beaming all the while
No one could be half so kind to me
Now she’s gone to Heaven and she’ll never return
To my little home in Tennessee 
I can still remember many years ago
When my sweetheart wandered by my side
Down among the mountains where wild flowers grow
There she promised she would be my bride 
Then another man won her heart and hand
She always meant the world to me
I was broken hearted and I went away
From my little home in Tennessee

What will the birds do, mother, in the spring
Will they gather the crumbs around our door
Will they fly from the nest to the top of the tree
And ask why Joe wanders out no more
What will the kitten do, mother, all alone
Will she stray from her frolic for a day
Will she lie on the rug beside my bed
Like she did before I went away
What will Thomas, the old gardener do
When you ask him for flowers for me
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care
The fairest one that lies around the tree
I saw the tears coming to his honest eyes
He said it was the wind that brought ’em there
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day
His hand trembled over my hair
Keep Tag, mother, my little dog
I know that he’ll mourn for me too
Keep him though blind and older he grows
To sleep in the whole summer through
Show him my coat, mother, so he may know
That his master then will be dead
Speak to him kindly and often of Joe
And pat him on his brown shaggy head
And you, dearest mother, shall miss me for a while
But in heaven I shall no larger grow
And any kind angel you meet at the gate
Can take you to your darling Little Joe

To give my horn a blow
And every girl in the countryside
Said yonder comes my beau
When I was a little boy
I liked to go in swimming
Now I am a bigger boy
I like to go with women
I wish I had a candy box
To put my sweetheart in

And put her back again
One day I set a-courting
A girl as dear as life
When a woman she said to me

Round that little log cabin by the sea
While mother read of Jesus who walked upon the waves
How Jesus calmed the stormy Gallilee
How often oh how often she read of glowing mirth
With a message from the precious word above
It told of faithful Daniel who trusted in the Lord
While it lead me in the pathway that she brought (?)
There is no other volume so precious as this book
It tells me how to live and how to die
It tells me of that city oh wondrous wondrous look
And that I’ll meet my loved ones by and by

And a banjo on her knee
Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain

Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty women were made for loving

Away by the waters so blue
The ladies were winding their way
While Pharaoh’s little daughter went down to the water
To bathe in the cool of the day
Before it was dark she opened the ark
And found the sweet babe that was there
And away by the waters so blue
The infant was lonely and sad
She took him in pity and thought him so pretty
And it made little Moses so glad
She called him her own, her beautiful son
And she sent for a nurse who was near
And away by the waters so blue
They carried that beautiful child
To his tender mother, to his sister and brothers
Little Moses looked happy and smiled
His mother so good did all that she could
To raise him and teach him with care
And away by the sea that was red
Little Moses the servant of God
While in him confided, the sea was divided
As upwards he lifted his rod
And the Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh’s host
Was drownded in the waters and lost
And away on a mountain so high
The last that he ever did see
With Israel victorious, his hopes were most glorious
That soon all the Jordan be free
When his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And rested in the Heavens above

There’s a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
There and old fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way
For what few coins the congregation could afford
Dressed in all out Sunday best we sat on pews of solid oak
And I remember how our voices filled the air
How mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
And when the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.
   Looking back now that little mountain church house
   Has become my life’s corner stone
   It was there in that little mountain church house
   I first heard the word I’ve based my life upon.
At the all day Sunday singing and dinner on the ground
Many were the souls that were revived
While my brothers and my sisters who’ve gone on to glory land
Slept in piece in the maple grove nearby

Carrying little Sadie to her burying ground
Well I began to think of what a deed I’d done
I grabbed my hat and away I run
Made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho
I was standing on the corner reading the bill
When up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
Said young man is your name Brown
Remember the night you shot Sadie down
Well I said yes sir but my name is Lee
And I shot little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and the second degree
If you got any papers won’t you read them to me

And they put me on a train and started me back
All the way back to that Thomasville jail
And I had no money for to go my bail

I met the contingent and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high
Go tell my companions and children most dear
To weep not for me while I’m gone
The same hand that led me through storms most severe
Has kindly assisted me on

   Lonely moon lonely moon won’t you shine in this cell
   And tell me that she’s doing well
   Lonely moon won’t you tell her I want her for mine
   But don’t push her she has her own mind.
As we gaze and admire the same shining stars
Though our distances are far
We can both watch the moon go down o’er the land
As if we were hand in hand.
Souls can be together while bodies are alone
Love can melt bars and climb walls of stone
We can both watch the moon go down o’er the land
As if we were hand in hand.

Lonely quit knockin’ on my door
Sadness don’t follow me around
You’re always by my side
Watchin’ every tear I’ve cried
Lonely quit knockin’ on my door
The picture that I’m lookin’ at right now
Is not the one she painted when we met
All I thought I had is gone
And I’m needin’ to move on
But a reason to just hasn’t hit me yet
My world blacked out the moment that she left
She slammed the door and didn’t say a word
Add them all up into one
Thunder lightning and big guns
And that’s still the loudest sound I ever heard
A man trapped behind a cell room wall
His time’s for life and nothin’ left to fear
He’s under lock and key and he’s just the same as me
But a different kind of sentence put me here

I was strolling one day in a lonely graveyard
When a voice from the tomb seemed to say
I once lived as you lived walked and talked as you talk
But from earth I was soon called away
   Oh those tombs (oh those tombs) lonely tombs (lonely tombs)
   Seemed to say in a low gentle tone
   Oh how sweet (oh how sweet) is the rest (is the rest)
   In our beautiful Heavenly home 
Every voice from the tomb seemed to whisper and say
Living man you must soon follow me
And I thought as I looked on those cold marble slabs
What a dark lonely place that must be 
Then I came to the place where my mother was laid
And in silence I stood by her tomb
And her voice seemed to say in a low gentle tone
I am safe with my Savior at home

Lonesome
For the arms that held me tight
Lonesome
For the lips that whispered goodnight

    But my friends know
    Lonesome
    Don’t matter where I go
Lonesome
Living in the past
Lonesome
For the love that didn’t last
    Like a man lost at sea
    No place to land
    Lonesome
    For someone to understand
Lonesome

Lonesome blue heartbroken
As here I sit alone
My sweetheart’s gone and left me
Now everything’s gone wrong
Her hair was dark and curly
And hung way down behind
But now she loves another
I’m run-ning on the vine
I ne-ver rode a boxcar
Until she turned me down
I’ll never love no other
I’ll never settle down
On down this lonesome railroad
My back to the old hometown
My past will always haunt me
And the girl who turned me down

and told someone goodbye

Forget the pain and bear your shame
And beg her not to go

And the loneliness will grow and grow

And lay awake at night
Crying and prayin for you to come home
You know now you’re weepin her right

There’s no one knows what I’ve gone through

Cause I’m lonesome lonesome for you

As the clock was striking four
And the smiling face of my darling
I may not see no more
Now I know what it means to be worried
To be all lonesome and blue
For the one that I loved so dearly
Has turned her back on me
Oh my mind is full of sorrow
And my heart is filled with pain
And I feel so broken hearted
Wont you please come back again

No one loves you like I do
Wont you take me back my darling
So I can prove my love to you
If you’ll accept me little darling
We will start our lives anew

Then I got up the sun was so bright
I looked all around but something’s not right
I walked out the door and there on a hill

As I started to leave those lonesome old hills
Leaving behind where I used to roam

And telling a story that makes me so blue

She’s been unfaithful unkind and untrue
But all that she’s done right now don’t matter

Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
   She walks these hills in a long black veil
   She visits my grave while the night winds wail
   Nobody knows, nobody sees
   Nobody knows but me
The judge said Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don’t have to die
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I’d been in the arms of my best friend’s wife
The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

I haven’t forgot the day you left me
The chances are I never will
I cried at least a month of Sundays
But I wondered if my heart would ever heal
And you knew how much 1 needed you
But still you turned away
Now you wantin’ to come back to me
Afraid you made a big mistake
You hope it’s not too late
Well look who’s needin’ who
It’s not me crying over you
I know just what you been through
Ain’t it strange
time changes things
Now look who’s needing who
I don’t want you thinking that I’m a cold heart
I’m not trying to turn my back on you
But the fire of love ain’t always welcome
You’ve been through a time or two
If I remember right
It wasn’t me who threw our love away
Have you forgot
not so long ago
I were where you are today
It was me begging you to stay
Thanks to anyone who can put me right on the missing words and put me right
on those that I’ve gotten wrong.

My father found stone that was hewed out the mountain
Lord, my father found the stone that came rolling down from Babylon
My father found the stone that was hewed out the mountain
Lord it’s tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
Oh yes tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
    I’m looking for the stone that was hewed out the mountain
    Lord I’m looking for the stone that came rolling down from Babylon
    I’m looking for the stone that was hewed out the mountain
    Lord it’s tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
    Oh yes tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
my mother…

Many years I’ve been lookin’ for a place to call home
But I still didn’t find it so I must travel on
I don’t care for the fine mansions on earth’s sinkin sand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
   Lord build me just a cabin in the corner of gloryland
   In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
   Where I can hear the angels and shake Jesus’ hand
    Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
Listen Lord I’m not askin’ to live in the midst
For I know that I’m not worthy of such splendor as this
When I ask Him for mercy while humbly I stand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
I’ve many dear loved one’s who’ve gone on this way
On the grapevine of mournin’ shall I hear them all say
Come and join in the singin’ and play in our band
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland

When the way seems dark and long
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
Give me grace to shout and shine
Ever in the life devine
Lord lead me on from day to day
   Oh lead me on from day to day
   I want to walk the holy way
   Oh friends forsake me all along
   I asked the Lord to lead me on
In this world of doubt and gloom
When all flowers start to bloom
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
I have put my faith in thee
‘Til the homely hour shall be
Lord lead me on from day to day
When old age is feeling on
And my strength is almost gone
Hold to my hand dear I pray
Surely thou will n’er forsake
And in heaven I’ll awake
Lord lead me on from day to day

Down life’s highway alone I trod
I’ve always put my trust in God
But you’ll find out that your silver and gold
Won’t pay the price to protect your soul
   Oh I want the Lord to protect my soul
   To lead me on to heaven’s door
   My life down here will soon be o’er
   And I want the Lord to protect my soul
There’s many a church down life’s highway
Where people sing rejoice and pray
Why don’t you stop at one and join the fold
And ask the Lord to protect your soul
When this ol’ world is doomed in sin
You’ll cry oh Lord please let me
It’ll be to late to make your call
To ask the lord to protect my soul

    Lonesome, lonesome, pining away
    Now you say its best to part
    Even though it breaks my heart
    I`m lost and I`ll never find the way
Since you said we must part darling you have broke my heart
I am drifting like a ship lost at sea
In a world of despair its so lonesome there
Why don`t you come back to me
You said you`d be true no one else would ever do
I believed you with all my heart and soul
But you broke every vow and its all over now
I`m left in this world lone and cold

I’m a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman’s lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I’m lost too late to pray
Lord, I’ve paid the cost on the lost highway
Now boys, don’t start your rambling round
On this road of sin or you’re sorrow bound
Take my advice or you’ll curse the day
You started rolling down that lost highway

Long John walkin’ around in the rain
He’s long gone Lost John
Long gone Lost John
No hat on his head no shoes on his feet
He’s a beggin the women for his meat
I had an ol’ dog and his name was
like a rabbit through Bowlin’ Green
Lost John walked around in rain
Around the corner left him sittin’ by the ol’ railroad

Our family is proud of their lost soldier son
Not because they believe in the flag or a gun
They miss him because they remember him well
And loved him so dearly ‘for the day that he fell
All I knew was the pictures some stories they told
About young Carl Junior that good hearted boy
We had a connection I’ll tell it to you
He liked the good music now just like I do
I see a kind face staring down from the wall
Every time that I pass through my grandparents hall
It’s almost reflection his face so like mine
My uncle Carl Junior now in the great line
My mother remembers the day that she heard
As she learned of her brother she spoke not a word
A small yellow paper received on that day
It read killed in action in France far away
They still love him dearly it all seems so sad
Grandmother grandfather my mother and dad
They cherish the last things he won from afar
That one purple heart and a bright silver star
Now nothing can bring the boy back to the fold
But his precious memories ever loving we hold
When the music is playing and we’re all gathered there
Our spirits rekindle no more to despair

We went out one evening my darling and I
She seemed so different and I wondered why
We stopped at a tavern and there I could see
That she loved another one better than me
   While they dancing and I sat alone
   I knew I had lost her the one I loved
   Lost to a stranger I never had seen
   The waltz they were playing had ended my dream
The band was playing an old fashioned waltz
The dance floor was crowded and it wasn’t long
When up stepped a stranger I never had seen
He asked my darling will you dance with me

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/love-and-wealth/,"Love And Wealth

Darling I am all alone in our little mountain home
It’s lonely cold and loveless now inside
For your childish vows of love lasted only one short year
Then you went away to be another’s bride
   You will never know the pain   
   That I felt the day you left
   Should you ever wed again
   Let me wish you love and wealth
For that same old whippoorwill   breaks the silence on the hill
As I stand and gaze upon it’s faded wall
Where your picture used to hang   in a little golden frame
And the vision of your smile I still recall

Now you can take my money and you can take my pride
You can take that long road down the mountain side
Go downtown and fool around but you’re not fooling me
I’m not the one you love so don’t come home to me
   I’m tired of being lied to tired of growing old
   Tired of living my life for love grown cold
Now you can catch a wild bird and you can set it free
But you can’t turn loose the pain that’s trapped inside of me
You can teach the cheating kind to live the golden rule
My mama didn’t raise me to be a dog-gone fool
Now you can take your whiskey and you can take your wine
And I might spend some lonely nights but I’ll just take my time
There comes a time a broken heart just has to close it’s door
Tired of giving part, just can’t give no more

That night we parted long ago
I vowed my love I’d never show
Sweetheart I find that I can’t hide
My love beneath this foolish pride
If I could hold you one more time
And kiss the lips that once were mine
It would ease this aching hearrt of mine
If you would say you love me one more time
Oh won’t you take me back once more
Give me the love I’m longing for
It would ease this aching heart of mine
If you would say you love me one more time

http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/song/love-of-the-mountains/,"Love Of The Mountains

Two trees on a hillside of the mountain
Always looking up towards the sky
Remind me of my papa and my mama
Who lived there eighty years before they died
   Now a bright moon is shining in the valley
   An old wagon leans against a stack of hay
   Two graves on a hillside by the cabin
   My mom and dad are resting there today
The burning of the green wood on the fireplace
The fallen snow around the red bud trees
The branches of the laurel by the creek bed
And the rippling waters of the gentle stream
Papa used to talk about the young days
When he and mama first were settled there
He spoke about the love of the mountains
That he and mama shared together there

As you read this letter that I write to you
Sweetheart I hope you understand
That you’re the only love I knew
Please forgive me if you can
   Sweetheart I beg you to come home tonight
   I’m so blue and all alone
   I promise that I’ll treat you right
   Love, oh love oh please come home
That old wind is cold and slowly creeping ’round
And the fire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
Your baby’s hungry sick and cold

As along lifes way you go
Clouds may hide the light of day
Have no fear for well you know
Love will roll the clouds away
    Love will roll the clouds away
    Turn the darkness into day
    I’m so glad I now can say
    Love will roll the clouds away
When the road is rough and long
And the world is cold and gray
Lift your voice in happy song
Love will roll the clouds away
God is watching over all
And he hears you when you pray
Trust in him when shadows fall
Love will roll the clouds away
